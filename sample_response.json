                            "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nKOBLITZ, J.A.D.\nWe granted plaintiff S.M. (Steve ) leave to appeal from a June 10, 2013 order preventing him from having any contact with his two children until the criminal charges against him are resolved. Steve seeks supervised therapeutic visits as recommended by two court-appointed experts. We reverse and remand for a hearing before the Family Part judge at which the prosecutor, criminal defense attorney and two family lawyers may be heard. We arrive at this conclusion relying on Rule 5:12-6 and a directive from the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC). See AOC Directive 03-09 (Directive) (relating to visitation when an abuse and neglect case is heard in the Family Part while a parent has criminal charges pending).\nPlaintiff and defendant K.M. (Kim) were married in 1998 and had two children, Jim, born in 2004, and Mary, born in 2000. On November 18, 2011, plaintiff was served with a temporary restraining order (TRO) at his home based on allegations that Steve placed a loaded BB gun to Jim’s head at some point between November 8, 2009 and November 11, 2011 and that he was abusive to Kim. The incident with the BB gun was reported to police by Jim’s school after his teacher overheard Jim tell a friend that “daddy put a gun” to his head and “dad is mean.” Defendant, K.M. (Kim) admitted during her interview with the court-appointed expert that there is significant ambiguity with the child’s statement.\nAfter obtaining Steve’s legally registered handgun, police discovered illegal hollow point bullets and plaintiff was later charged with a weapons offense.\nOn December 1, 2011, Steve filed a complaint for divorce. A January 3, 2012 order reflected the parties’ consent to Kim retaining temporary custody of the children and Steve being prohibited from any âform of contact” with Kim. The consent order acknowledged that Kim voluntarily dismissed her TRO, relying on the January 3 no-contact order, and that violation of “the no contact provision of this Order by Plaintiff shall be considered an indicia of an act of domestic violence!.]â The consent order also provided that Steve “shall have visitation with the minor children of the marriage in accordance with the dictates of the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office and/or the Court!.]”\nIn February 2012, the family judge appointed Lee Monday, Ph.D. to provide a visitation and custody evaluation of Steve. A week later, Steve consented to a drug and alcohol assessment to be performed by Gregg Benson, M.A., C.A.D.C., C.M.S.\nIn March 2012, the Division of Youth and Family Services (Division) sent a letter to Kim explaining that it investigated allegations of abuse and neglect against Steve and “determined that child abuse was substantiated.” The Division took no further action.\nOn June 4, 2012, Dr. Monday submitted a detailed, single-spaced, twenty-one page custody and visitation report with the court after interviewing all members of the family and administering psychological tests to Steve. Kim told Dr. Monday that “[h]er children have clearly stated that they do not want any relationship with their father. They are traumatized and fearful of him. [Kim] does not believe that it would be best for them to even have supervised visits with [Steve].” The report concluded that the case “is essentially a classic he said, she said[ ]” in which Kim and Steve provided starkly different accounts of Steve’s drinking habits and his relationship with their children. Dr. Monday found it noteworthy that the children referred to their relationship with Steve using the collective “we,” which, in the expert’s opinion, made it âdifficult to tell if it was truly the child’s individual perception of the father or if it is a joint perception shared with the mother.” “The goal for this family[,]” Monday opined, “is for [Steve] and his children to have a positive relationship.” He also noted that the children must feel safe and Steve cannot drink alcohol in their presence. Dr. Monday recommended that the children see a psychologist or counselor with expertise in “high conflict divorce cases” and that Steve should join the sessions once the children develop rapport with the counselor. “What would follow depends on how these sessions go[,]” the report stated.\nOn August 3, 2012, the criminal judge maintained the “no contact” condition of bail, explaining that he would “follow a ruling from the family judge on that issue.” On September 25, the family judge denied Steve’s request for therapeutic visitation, finding that it would be contrary to the best interests of the children.\nOn November 12, 2012, Steve was indicted for second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4a, second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4a, and fourth-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-lb(4).\nOn March 14, 2013, Benson released a comprehensive, single-spaced, twenty-six page “Substance Use Disorder Evaluation” of Steve. Benson conducted several tests that are recognized in the field and formed the impression “from all the gathered informa tion that [Steve] is a consistent blackout drinker to a degree much greater than he is aware and/or willing to admit.” Among other recommendations, Benson concurred fully with Dr. Monday’s visitation recommendations.\nIn April 2013, Steve again moved before the Family Part for therapeutic visitation with his children certifying that he had not seen them since November 2011. Steve stated that he was seeking psychological treatment and that he should be permitted visitation based on the recommendation of the two experts.\nWithout oral argument, the judge denied Steve any contact with his children. In an attached statement to his June order, the motion judge gave as his only reason that “the Court is not convinced that granting Plaintiffs request for supervised therapeutic visitation would be in the best interest of the children during the pendency of the criminal proceedings against plaintiff.” We granted leave to appeal “in the interest of justiee[,]” R. 2:2-A, because depriving children of all contact with their father is an extreme measure that, if improperly imposed and maintained for a lengthy period of time, could cause severe injury to the children. See V.C. v. M.J.B., 163 N.J. 200, 229, 748 A.2d 539, (explaining that permanent denial of visitation is such an “extraordinary proscription that it should be invoked only in those exceptional cases where it clearly and convincingly appears that the granting of visitation will cause physical or emotional harm to the children or where it is demonstrated that the parent is unfit[]”), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 926, 121 S.Ct. 302, 148 L.Ed.2d 243 (2000); see also, N.J. Div. of Youth & Family Servs. v. F.M., 375 N.J.Super. 235, 264, 867 A.2d 499 (App.Div.2005) (noting that experts are increasingly concerned about the harm to the child caused by the loss of a parent and are “recognizing the need for continued contact with a biological parent, even a flawed parent____”). In the context of this case, where the Division could well have filed a complaint for abuse and neglect if Kim were not deemed a safe custodial parent, it is instructive to look at the law controlling child protective services cases.\nNot only do parents have a constitutional right to enjoy a relationship with their children, In Re Guardianship of K.H.O., 161 N.J. 337, 346, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999), children likewise have the right to visit with their parents after they have been removed from the parent’s home. N.J.S.A. 9:6B-4A(e). This is so even if the children verbalize a desire not to see the parent, as happened here. The Children’s Bill of Rights states that a child has the right “to visit with [his or her] parents or legal guardians ...” or to “otherwise maintain contact with [his or her] parents or legal guardian____” Ibid. A child’s best interests are generally fostered when both parents are involved with the child, assuring the child of frequent and continuing contact with both parties. Finamore v. Aronson, 382 N.J.Super. 514, 523, 889 A.2d 1114 (App.Div.2006).\nRule 5:12-6 states that “when a criminal complaint has been filed against a parent or guardian arising out of the same incident as the [Division] action ... the Family Part shall determine the nature and scope of parental or guardian visitation, if any____” The Rule further explains that upon “scheduling any hearing at which visitation conditions are to be imposed or modified, the court shall provide notice to the county prosecutor____” R. 5:12-6(a)(1). The Rules of Court also provide that if a criminal court imposes a no contact order as a condition of bail, as here, “such restrictions shall not affect contact authorized by an order of the Family Part in a child abuse/neglect case entered after any restrictions on contact was imposed as part of a bail order.” R. 3:26 — 1(b). Here, the criminal judge specifically deferred to the family judge as required by the Rule.\nThe Administrative Office of the Courts promulgated procedures for “co-occurring child abuse and domestic violence” cases in which an abuse and neglect case is filed concurrently with a complaint alleging domestic violence against the child. Directive at 2-9. The aim of the Directive was to “coordinate the interface of policies ... to ensure effective handling of cases of co-occurrence[]” when there is pending both a child protective services action and a criminal complaint against a parent. Directive at 2.\nThe purpose of the directive is to provide “operational guidance” to judges and staff in achieving the statutory mandate of N.J.S.A. 20:25-18, which is intended to protect “victims of violence that occurs in a family or family like setting by providing access to both emergent and long-term civil and criminal remedies.... ”\nThe Directive points out the provision of Rule 5:12-6 requiring the inclusion of the prosecutor and criminal defense attorney in the hearing before the family judge to determine whether and what type of visitation to accord the accused parent. While the State submitted a letter to the criminal judge “strenuously” opposing any modification in bail conditions to allow Steve to see his children, in that letter the prosecutor simply reiterates the charges against plaintiff and their potential sentences. We do not know whether this letter was actually seen by the family judge.\nNeither party requested a plenary hearing before the family judge nor on appeal. Thus, we leave to the sound discretion of the family judge whether such a hearing is necessary to decide this temporary visitation dispute or whether oral argument and consideration of documentary evidence is sufficient. See, Wilke v. Culp, 196 N.J.Super. 487, 502-03, 483 A.2d 420 (App.Div.1984) (noting in a non-temporary visitation dispute that the Family Part ordinarily conducts a plenary hearing when the facts are contested), certif. denied, 99 N.J. 243, 491 A.2d 728 (1985).\nWe therefore remand this matter to the Family Part judge to determine whether supervised therapeutic visitation with Steve is in the best interests of the children. We direct the judge to follow the procedures set forth in Rule 5:12-6 and the Directive.\nReversed and remanded.\nWe use initials and fictitious names to protect the identity of the children.\nWe note that an administrative directive has the force of law. State v. Morales, 390 N.J.Super. 470, 472, 915 A.2d 1090 (App.Div.2007).\nThe Division of Youth and Family Services has been renamed as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency as part of the reorganization of the Department of Children and Families pursuant to L. 2012, c. 16, eff. July 2, 2012.\nWe note that this report was submitted five months before Steve was indicted, but nearly six months after Steve was served with a criminal complaint and after a judge determined there to be probable cause for the charges.\nThe court did not hold oral argument, although requested by Steve if opposition was filed, because \"oral argument would not have advanced the Court’s understanding of these matters____” We note that requests for oral argument should ordinarily be honored, especially in family motions. R. 5:5-4(a).\nIn determining custody, for example, the “preference of the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent decision\" is only one factor a court must consider. N.J.S.A. 9:2-4(c).",

                            "text": "Justice LaVECCHIA\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nDefendant Stephen Scharf was convicted of first-degree purposeful and knowing murder of his wife Jody, who fell to her death off a cliff at the Palisades. Defendant put forward a defense of accident. During the trial, the court allowed the State to present, in rebuttal to the defense of accident, hearsay statements, under N.J.R.E. 803(e)(3) and (c)(4), from Jody’s friends and her therapist. The witnesses claimed that Jody repeatedly told them of her fear of defendant, particularly after she had served him with a divorce complaint, and told them that she had declined defendant’s request to go to the Palisades cliffs with him shortly before her death.\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division reversed the conviction because the reviewing court concluded that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements. The case is before us on the State’s petition for certification. State v. Scharf, 221 N.J. 219, 110 A.3d 931 (2015). The appeal requires us to address whether it was error for the trial court to have admitted the evidence and, even if the evidence was admissible, whether the evidence, cumulatively, constituted an abuse of the trial court’s discretion that caused defendant’s trial to be unjust.\nI.\nA.\nOn September 20, 1992, Palisades Interstate Parkway police officers responded to a report that a person had fallen from the Englewood cliffs. First responder, Officer Paul Abbott, explained in his testimony that the cliffs provide a scenic lookout across the Hudson River. When Abbott arrived at the scene at approximately 8:12 p.m., it was already dark. Defendant approached Abbott in the parking area and told him that his wife had fallen from the cliff. Abbott drove defendant to the northern end of the cliffs — the area from which defendant said that his wife had fallen. Officer Lowell Tomayo, who responded to the scene with Abbott, followed in a second vehicle. Upon arriving at the northern end of the cliffs, defendant guided the officers on foot down an unmaintained and overgrown path into a wooded area.\n. According to testimony from Abbott and Tomayo, the officers and defendant eventually reached the edge of the cliff, and defendant indicated the precise spot from where his wife had fallen, pointing to a flat rock that jutted out from the cliff. A fence separated the wooded area from the cliffs edge. The officers crossed the fence and called Jody’s name, but received no response. The officers saw a poeketbook lying approximately eight feet below the cliff; it was later identified as belonging to Jody. Jody’s body was recovered late that night. Forensic examination of her body established that, at the time of her death, she had a blood alcohol content of 0.12%.\nDefendant was escorted to police headquarters, where he spoke with Detective Ronald Karnick and gave a written statement concerning what had happened that evening. In that statement, defendant told Karnick that he and his wife had planned to go into New York City to a comedy club that evening, that the lookout on the cliff had been “their spot,” and that they had been drinking in their car prior to walking to the lookout point. Defendant said that he and Jody walked down the trail, climbed through the fence, and sat on the flat rock that he had shown to the officers earlier. According to defendant, he and Jody began engaging in amorous activities, at which point Jody indicated she was uncomfortable so he offered to retrieve a blanket and some wine from the car. Defendant said that he and Jody both stood up, and then Jody suddenly fell forward off the rock. Defendant said that he called her name but received no response.\nKamick obtained defendant’s permission to search his vehicle and found in it a cooler, a wine glass, two wine coolers (one full, one empty), a bottle of wine, a knife, a blanket, some bandages, two white towels, a candle, a receipt, a box of crackers, a jewelry box containing a cross and a “gold-type chain,” and a claw hammer.\nAs the investigation continued, subsequent questioning of defendant uncovered additional information. Defendant revealed that, two weeks prior to her death, Jody served defendant with a divorce complaint that alleged defendant was abusive and unfaithful. Defendant told investigators that Jody was a heavy drinker and that both he and she had dated other people as part of an open marriage. However, defendant told the investigators that he had ended his relationships with the other women and hoped that a “trip to the cliffs” would lead to his and Jody’s reconciliation.\nIn an interview a few days after Jody’s death, defendant stated that he and his wife had planned to go out to dinner and then to New York City on September 20, 1992, the evening of her death. Defendant told the officers that, the night before, he and Jody had dined out together with their son, but on the next evening, which was a Sunday, they arranged for someone to watch their son. They were on the way to New York City, from their home in Morris County, when, defendant claimed, he and Jody decided to make a detour to the cliffs.\nAt the time of law enforcement’s initial investigation into the circumstances of Jody’s death, interviews of Jody’s friends and acquaintances called into question several of defendant’s assertions, including Jody’s state of mind, her activities, and her interactions with defendant leading up to her death. Also, accord ing to the testimony of the investigating officers, defendant’s responses to repeated questioning revealed inconsistencies, including differing versions of how the fall occurred, and some inculpato-ry indications. Nonetheless, the criminal investigation into the circumstances of Jody’s death did not lead initially to charges being filed against defendant. However, certain events that occurred after Jody’s death and before defendant’s indictment bear notice at this point.\nAt the time Jody died, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was “multiple fractures and injuries”; however, the examiner remained uncertain about the “manner of death” and listed it as “pending investigation” on the death certificate. The medical examiner amended the “manner of death” in 1993 to “could not be determined.”\nThe record also reveals that, during the year prior to her death, defendant obtained a life insurance policy on Jody in the amount of $500,000 — $300,000 as a basic amount of insurance and $200,000 as an accidental death benefit. After Jody’s death, defendant did not file a claim for the proceeds of that policy. After the proceeds had remained unclaimed for the lawfully required number of years, the insurer forwarded the monies to the State as unclaimed funds. See N.J.S.A. 46:30B-9, -22. In 2003, defendant claimed the money held by the State, which had grown to $770,650.83 with interest.\nThe Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office reevaluated the circumstances of Jody’s death in 2004, and for the first time, the medical examiner went to the location at the cliffs to view the area where Jody fell and where her body was recovered.\nAfter reinvestigation of the matter, in 2007, the medical examiner amended the “manner of death” on Jodyâs death certificate from “could not be determined” to “homicide.” The Bergen County Prosecutor’s reevaluation of the evidence and follow-up interviews, detailed in the discussion of the trial testimony, led to a decision to pursue a murder charge against defendant for the 1992 death of his wife.\nA grand jury indicted defendant for first-degree purposeful and knowing murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:ll-3(a)(l) and 2C:ll-3(a)(2).\nB.\nAs noted, defendant proffered a defense of accident. The State’s evidence in preparation for trial included oral statements made by Jody to her friends and to her therapist, which were proposed for admission by the State as going to the state of mind of the victim. The State sought to use the evidence to rebut defendant’s narrative that Jody’s death was due to an unfortunate accident that took place when he and she were alone on the cliffs on the evening of Sunday, September 20,1992.\nThe defense filed a pretrial motion to exclude Jody’s hearsay statements. At the pretrial hearing on the motion, defense counsel “acknowledge[d] that where accident is the defense [state-of-mind evidence] may become probative.” However, defense counsel stressed the large volume of potential state-of-mind evidence that was proffered by the State (there were thirty-four potential statements from twenty-six witnesses), arguing that the trial court needed to determine whether the statements made by Jody were made in good faith at the time when they were spoken. In response to the motion, the State whittled down its list of proposed witnesses on this issue. It clarified its intent to rely on Jody’s statements to six individuals regarding her state of mind around the time of her death.\nIn a written decision issued April 11, 2011, the trial court denied defendant’s motions to exclude the proposed testimony of Jody’s statements to friends and to exclude the statements made to her therapist. The trial court acknowledged that twenty-six individuals had provided the State with approximately thirty-four statements made by Jody, but that the State had narrowed that list down to the ones before the court. The court stated that it carefully reviewed those statements prior to ruling to assess whether they contained admissible evidence. After reviewing the state-of-mind hearsay exception under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(3), and noting that defendant was arguing that Jody’s fall was accidental, the court stated that “New Jersey courts have recognized that when a defendant claims that the victim’s death was accidental, then the victim’s state of mind becomes relevant and the victim’s statements of fear become[ ] admissible.” The court found Jodyâs state of mind to be “highly probative” on the issues to be tried in this matter and concluded that the State should be permitted to introduce the testimony of the six witnesses who would tell of Jody’s expressed fear of defendant and of his abusive conduct, her expressed intent to continue with the divorce proceedings initiated against defendant, and her expressed fear of heights.\nAccording to the trial court, Jody’s statements to those six identified individuals were made close enough in time to the events of September 20, 1992 and would provide evidence that would “directly counter” defendant’s assertion that Jody’s fall from the Palisades cliffs while alone with defendant was accidental. The court specifically stated that it would allow limited reference to alleged domestic violence to be elicited from the witnesses and only for the “singular purpose” of showing Jody’s state of mind. However, the court warned that the statements would not be permitted to “prove the defendant’s motivation or conduct” and emphasized that “[t]hese statements are solely admissible to show Jody’s state of mind.” The court directed the attorneys to prepare limiting instructions that would be provided to the jury in order to make that distinction clear.\nConcerning the proposed testimony by Jody’s therapist, the court found that a statement made by Jody to the therapist— namely, that she had refused defendant’s invitation to accompany him on a picnic to the Palisades and that she had never been to that spot before — -was admissible under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(3). The court considered the statement to relate to the “relationship between Jody and defendant” and to be part of “the ‘mosaic’ of the event.” The court explained that the fact that Jody told her therapist that she had never been to the Palisades was “part of the totality of her relationship with the defendant and placed in issue the defendant’s version of their marital relationship.”\nThe court allowed the admission of other statements made by Jody to her therapist under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(4) as statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment. To that end, the court found that “the statements relating to both the cause and symptoms of Jody’s depression carr[ied] with them inherent reliability because Jody would necessarily have believed that effective treatment ... was largely dependent upon the accuracy of the information provided to” her therapist. In admitting that testimony, the court stated it was convinced that Jody’s statements to her therapist were “medically necessary for effective treatment,” adding that it considered it appropriate to allow the therapist’s testimony “as to cause, symptoms and feelings Jody conveyed to her while she was treating Jody for depression.” Again, the court asked the attorneys to prepare an appropriate limiting instruction that would discuss the purpose for which this evidence could be considered by the jury.\nC.\nDefendant’s jury trial began with opening statements on April 19, 2011. Over the entire first two days of trial, the State called three witnesses: Jonathan Scharf, the son of Jody and defendant, and two women with whom defendant had had extramarital relationships.\nJonathan’s testimony was damaging to his father, although the defense brought out differences between Jonathan’s interview at the time of his mother’s death when he was a child, and which was apparently not recorded, and his recorded testimony at the time of his father’s arrest, as well as additional information that did not come out until trial. Undermining the narrative presented by defendant to police interrogators, Jonathan, who was ten years old at the time of his mother’s death, testified that he accompanied his parents when they went out to dinner the Saturday night before Jody’s death because Jody had not wanted to go out alone with defendant; she had insisted that Jonathan had to be with them. He also testified that his parents had never been to the cliffs before the date of the incident. His testimony also included reference to his mother’s fear of heights, even to the extent that she would not climb a step ladder because of that fear.\nThe two women who had extramarital affairs with defendant also provided damaging testimony, specifically recounting statements by defendant that negated his assertion that he had ended his extramarital relationships with them.\nT.S. testified that she began dating defendant in 1990 and that after about six to seven months, he began to regularly spend three nights per week at her home. T.S. testified that defendant never expressed a desire to end their relationship. Defendant had told T.S. that he was not married — he claimed that his wife had died in a car accident in Georgia ten years earlier — and that he had fathered his son Jonathan with a “career woman” who lived in the same residential complex as him but who did not want to get married. According to T.S., defendant told her that the custody arrangement over Jonathan was âamicable.” At some point, defendant mentioned the possibility of marriage. Although T.S. was not interested in marriage, the relationship continued. More specifically to the time period of Jody’s death, T.S. testified that defendant did not join her as planned on a long Labor Day weekend trip in September 1992. Arriving late, defendant told her that he was under a lot of stress, apologized, and stated that, if T.S. would “give [him] to the end of September ... everything will be okay, the stress will be — a lot of the stress will be gone.”\nThe other woman who testified, K.S., met defendant in 1990 through a newspaper dating advertisement. Defendant told K.S. that he was divorced and had a son. As they continued to see each other, defendant later admitted that he was married, but claimed that he was planning to get a divorce. K.S. stated that she contacted Jody by phone and that Jody also told her that she and defendant were separated and that they dated other people. The relationship between K.S. and defendant ended shortly thereafter.\nK.S. testified that defendant continued to contact her through the end of 1990 into 1991 and that, in the early part of 1992, K.S. began to see defendant again once defendant informed her that Jody was going to file for divorce. K.S. stated that defendant even showed her in July of 1992 the as-yet unserved divorce papers that Jody’s attorney had prepared.\nIn her testimony, K.S. described her relationship with defendant in September 1992 as âserious,” stating that the two had briefly discussed marriage. Defendant had never expressed a desire to end their relationship, according to K.S. She testified that defendant called her to inform her of Jody’s death, explaining that they had gone to the Palisades and Jody had fallen from a rock.\nIt was on the third day of the trial that the State called five witnesses to testify to the statements, made by Jody to them, that are at issue in this appeal. The testimony of all five individuals was completed that day. The great bulk of the testimony that day came from the first two witnesses, M.H., Jody’s friend, and Patricia Teague, Jody’s therapist.\nM.H. testified that she and Jody became friends because they frequented the same lunch spot when the two were in the same area conducting business. She stated that Jody was “very frightened of [defendant].” M.H. described how, in the month leading up to Jody’s death, Jody frequently mentioned her fear of defendant, stating that she “felt he was going to really hurt her.” Having gone through a divorce fifteen years earlier, M.H. had discussed with Jody taking steps toward a divorce. Jody confided in M.H. around the time that she served defendant with divorce papers in the late summer of 1992, telling M.H. that she “was very afraid” and that she feared that “once these papers are served on [her] husband ... something’s going to happen to [her].” M.H. added that Jody was “very afraid for her life” and “very afraid that he was going to kill her.” According to M.H., Jody said that “if anything happens after this, I want you to know who did it.” Defense counsel did not object during M.H.’s testimony.\nThe second witness, Jodyâs therapist, Patricia Teague, testified that “verbal, mental physical abuse” led to Jody’s feelings of serious depression, which were the focus of their sessions together. Teague also stated that in the course of their discussions Jody had told her that she had never been to the cliffs and that, although defendant recently had invited her to go with him to the cliffs, she had told Teague that she did not intend to go there ever with defendant. Defense counsel did not object to this testimony.\nThe third witness was M.G., who testified that she knew Jody because she worked at a restaurant frequented by Jody and her son, when he had activities going on in a park nearby, or sometimes by Jody alone. M.G. testified that she last saw Jody on the Saturday before she died when Jody came into the restaurant. Because she was busy with customers, M.G. was unable to talk with Jody, but she was passed a note from Jody, which informed her that Jody had served defendant with divorce papers on Friday and that defendant “was very unhappy about it and ... she was kind of afraid.â Although in the note Jody had asked M.G. to call her later, M.G. did not. By way of background, M.G. explained that she and Jody had discussed Jody’s marital problems in previous conversations and how Jody wanted defendant out of the house. On cross-examination, M.G. added that she had encour aged Jody to take legal action to help herself. Again, defense counsel did not object.\nWhen the fourth witness, M.D., was called to the stand, defense counsel requested to be heard at sidebar. In that exchange, defense counsel registered an objection to the next witnesses, claiming that the testimony was cumulative. Counsel stated, “I expect the Prosecutor basically to put another three witnesses [on] to say the exact same thing that Jody says, she was afraid of my client and I think it[’s] gotten to the point where it’s cumulative and that it shouldn’t proceed any further. All these witnesses are basically going to say the exact same thing.” The prosecutor responded that each witness came from a different part of Jody’s life and asserted the right to present those different perspectives. The court allowed the testimony to proceed, stating: “Okay. All right. The objection is that it’s cumulative. Let’s see what they have to say. You can make further objections.”\nThe remaining two witnesses were brief, comprising respectively twelve and ten pages of transcript, direct and cross-examination combined.\nM.D., defendant’s and Jody’s neighbor, testified that she last saw Jody on the Saturday before she died because she was working at the same restaurant as M.G. M.D. stated that Jody told her that she had filed for divorce, that she had served defendant with divorce papers, and that defendant had refused to sign the papers and threatened her life. M.D. also stated that Jody had “feared for her life” and that defendant had told her, upon receiving the divorce papers, that “he would see her dead before he’d let her â before he would sign them.” Defense counsel did not object to that content but, at the conclusion of M.D.’s testimony, stated that he was “just making that continuing objection that [he] made at last sidebar.”\nThe last witness called by the State that day was A.R., who worked as a bartender at the restaurant where Jody and M.H. would meet for lunch on workdays. According to A.R., Jody had told her that defendant was abusive and had shown A.R. a photo of defendant after she filed for the divorce so A.R. could recognize him, and let Jody know if he ever came into the restaurant. She also stated that, when she saw Jody the Friday before she died, Jody was very upset and told her that she “was afraid [defendant] was going to kill her because of the divorce.” Defense counsel did not object.\nThroughout the testimony of those witnesses, defendant did not request a limiting instruction to the jury, despite the court’s pretrial request for counsel to develop and propose a limiting instruction for the court’s use. The topic of a limiting instruction did not come up until the charge conference.\nOver the next seven days of the trial, the State presented testimony from fourteen witnesses concerning physical and forensic evidence obtained during the investigation into Jody’s death. The State called the investigating officers who responded to the scene the evening of Jody’s fall, the ones who were responsible for executing consent searches of defendant’s vehicle and residence, and the ones who later interviewed defendant. Those officers discussed certain behaviors exhibited by defendant during their investigation and how his statements were, at times, inconsistent. One officer who was with defendant during the search of defendant’s residence, testified that defendant said to him “you don’t believe this was an accident.” The officer responded that he did “believe an accident happened,” but that when he in turn asked defendant if it was, defendant shook his head somewhat and replied “noâ as he put his head down. Another officer who was present also testified to witnessing that exchange.\nAlso testifying for the State were members of the rescue team involved in recovering Jody’s body. The State then presented the testimony of a land surveyor, who had measured the height of the cliffs, and an investigator who took measurements of the area and conducted and videotaped experiments that involved throwing sandbags matching Jodyâs weight off the cliff. Finally, the State called two forensic pathologists, one of whom had composed the autopsy report. A summary of their testimony follows.\nDr. Maryann Clayton, who performed the autopsy on Jody, initially noted that the majority of Jody’s injuries were to her head and face, as well as to the right side of her body. At the time the autopsy was performed, Dr. Clayton determined that the cause of death was multiple fractures and injuries, but the manner of death was listed as “pending investigation” on the original death certificate. Dr. Clayton also noted at that time that she found it unusual that there were no visible indications of abrasions, lacerations, or contusions on the back surface of Jody’s body, nor were there any breaks in her arm, pelvic, or leg bones.\nIn January 1993, Dr. Clayton concluded that the manner of death could not be determined and an amendment to the death certificate was entered. In January of 2006, as part of a reinvestigation into Jody’s death, Dr. Clayton journeyed for the first time to the bottom of the cliffs to view the place from which Jody’s body was recovered. That different perspective led Dr. Clayton to conclude that Jody’s injuries were ânot consistent with a patient that passively rolls down the cliffs to the bottom and meets their demise.” Dr. Clayton also noted that Jody’s injuries were unlike those of other individuals who had died as a result of falling from a high distance. Dr. Clayton thus concluded that Jody had to have experienced a “propulsive force,” meaning that “[s]he had to be propelled out to be able to reach” the tree that she struck on the way down. Dr. Clayton then amended the manner of Jody’s death to homicide.\nThe other forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, became involved with the case in 2004 when contacted by the Prosecutor’s Office during the reinvestigation into Jody’s death. Dr. Baden noted that the distance from the point where an individual fell to where the individual landed is an important factor in determining the manner in which someone fell. For example, Dr. Baden stated that a person who fell accidentally would be “within a couple of feet of the baseâ from which he or she fell while a person who is propelled would be a “much larger” distance away. With that in mind, Dr. Baden concluded that Jody’s injuries were “not consistent with an innocent fall from the point indicated at that lookout area.” Dr. Baden, like Dr. Clayton, also concluded that the manner of death was homicide, given that a body from an innocent fall “could not go out that far” and that Jody “had to have been propelled from that point” on the cliffs.\nSummations occurred on May 24, 2011, and the trial court instructed the jury that same day. The instruction provided on the state-of-mind hearsay testimony was negotiated between the parties and was what the defense had requested. The court instructed the jury that, “[i]f you find that she made these statements then you may consider them only for the purpose of determining her state of mind at the time those statements were made and for no other reason.”\nDefendant was convicted of first-degree purposeful and knowing murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:ll-3(a)(l) and N.J.S.A. 2C:11 — 3(a)(2), and was sentenced to life in prison, subject to thirty years of parole ineligibility.\nDefendant appealed, and the Appellate Division reversed his conviction. The primary issue for the panel was whether the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements from Jody’s friends and therapist. To the panel, Jody’s âexpressions of fear of defendant were neither relevant nor material” and also were “highly prejudicial and clearly cumulative.”\nThe panel determined that Jody’s statements were not relevant because her state of mind was not at issue. According to the panel, Jody’s “fear of defendant, even if based on their past history, simply does not make it more or less likely that, once having gone to the Englewood Cliffs with defendant, while she was under the influence of alcohol, an accident could not have occurred.” To that end, the panel noted that “[tjhere is no reason that the victim’s fear of defendant would have made it less likely that an accident occurred.” Additionally, the panel did not find a connection between Jody’s state of mind and her conduct, because, regardless of her fear of defendant, there had been testimony at trial that she had spent time with defendant the night before her death. According to the panel, the prejudicial impact of evidence of Jody’s fear outweighed any probative value.\nThe panel reached the same conclusion regarding Teague’s testimony with “regard to [Jody’s] fear of defendant and any history of domestic violence.” Those statements were determined not to meet the standard for relevancy under N.J.R.E. 401 because the panel did not view Jody’s “state of mind, her fear, and the alleged abuse inflicted by defendant [as] probative on any issue in the case.” The panel further held Jody’s statement to Teague — that she had never been to the cliffs and declined defendant’s invitation to go there with him â was also inadmissible.\nThe panel concluded that those errors were “clearly capable of producing an unjust result,” R. 2:10-2, reversed defendant’s conviction, and remanded the matter for retrial.\nWe granted the State’s petition for certification. We also granted amicus curiae status to the Attorney General of New Jersey.\nII.\nThe State argues essentially the same points made to the Appellate Division. It maintains that evidence of Jody’s state of mind was relevant to counter the defense that Jody’s death was accidental and was admissible under hearsay exceptions. The testimony was limited to only five witnesses and was kept limited to a proper purpose. The State maintains that admission of the evidence was not error but rather a proper exercise of the trial court’s discretionary role as the gatekeeper of evidence permitted to be introduced at trial. As for the court’s charge to the jury, the State notes that the defense did not provide the court with any specific proposal or request with respect to limiting instructions that would have been more adequate than what the trial court provided. Thus, the State contends that defendant’s trial was not unjust.\nThe Attorney General’s arguments support those advanced by the State, emphasizing that the charge delivered to the jury was a negotiated one.\nThe defense urges affirmance of the Appellate Division’s judgment. It argues that Jody’s state of mind is not relevant because the State failed to show how Jody’s fear of defendant makes it more or less likely that defendant intentionally pushed Jody from the cliff rather than that she had an accidental fall. To that end, defendant contends that hearsay declarations of a decedent’s fear of a defendant are generally inadmissible because the decedent’s state of mind — that he or she was fearful of a defendant — is not relevant to answering the principal question in a homicide trial: whether the defendant killed with the requisite state of mind. Testimony regarding Jody’s state of mind at the time of her death cannot be used, according to defendant, to infer defendant’s actions on the night of her death.\nMoreover, defendant continues, the statements are highly prejudicial because “[they] raise[ ] in the jurors’ minds the specter of a frightening defendant worthy of the decedent’s fear.” According to defendant, our case law requires that courts look to whether the declarant’s state of mind actually proves any matter in the dispute or whether it serves to simply inflame the prejudice of the jury. Thus, defendant emphasizes that any testimony regarding Jody’s fear of defendant should have been regarded as inadmissible hearsay due to its “extreme potential to inflame the jury.”\nIII.\nA.\nIn this review of the admission of hearsay testimony about the decedent’s expressions of fear of her husband uttered shortly before her death under unusual circumstances, we must begin with basics.\nEvidence must be relevant for it to be admissible, meaning that it must have “a tendency in reason to prove or disprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action.” N.J.R.E. 401; see State v. Darby, 174 N.J. 509, 519, 809 A.2d 138 (2002) (explaining that “the inquiry should focus on the logical connection between the proffered evidence and a fact in issueâ (quotation marks omitted)). In the search for the truth, all relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise excluded by the New Jersey Rules of Evidence. See N.J.R.E. 402.\nThe Evidence Rules take special care to limit the admissibility of hearsay testimony. See N.J.R.E. 801(c) (defining hearsay as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted”). Generally, hearsay is not admissible, “except as provided by [New Jersey’s rules of evidence] or by other law.” N.J.R.E. 802.\nOne exception allowing for the admission of hearsay is the state-of-mind exception. N.J.R.E. 803(c)(3) provides:\nA statement made in good faith of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, or bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant’s will.\nWhen a matter places a declarant’s state of mind in issue, the Rule allows a declarant’s out-of-court statement to be admitted for that singular purpose. State v. Benedetto, 120 N.J. 250, 255-56, 576 A.2d 828 (1990). The exception is applied carefully; hearsay testimony is admissible on state of mind when it is relevant and bears a logical connection to the issues at trial. State v. McLaughlin, 205 N.J. 185, 189, 14 A.3d 720 (2011). Our case law bears out that cautious approach.\nWhen it comes to an expression of fear by the out-of-court declarant, the state-of-mind exception is analyzed carefully concerning its relation to the issues at trial and whether the hearsay should be permitted for a limited use. The state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule does not broadly allow admission of a victim’s recounting of a defendant’s threats. See, e.g., Benedetto, supra, 120 N.J. at 259-61, 576 A.2d 828 (finding that victim’s statements describing threats were “not relevant to any issue and not explanatory of how defendant had acted on the night of [the victim’s death]”); State v. Downey, 206 N.J.Super. 382, 392, 502 A.2d 1171 (App.Div.1986) (noting weight of authority supporting same).\nHowever, declarations of fear can be admitted “to establish ] that the decedent was not the aggressor, did not commit suicide and was not accidently killed,” provided that those matters satisfy the relevancy requirement. State v. Machado, 111 N.J. 480, 485, 545 A.2d 174 (1988) (citing Downey, supra, 206 N.J.Super. at 392-93, 502 A.2d 1171); see also State v. Calleia, 206 N.J. 274, 292, 20 A.3d 402 (2011) (noting general guidance that “declaration of the victim’s state of mind ... should not be used to prove the defendant’s motivation or conduct” (quotation marks and citation omitted)). A victim’s state-of-mind hearsay statements are relevant to assessments of his or her own actions, and thus such statements can be relevant in the assessment of the truth of another’s stated reasons for conduct that occurred with that victim. Calleia, supra, 206 N.J. at 296, 20 A.3d 402.\nMore specifically to the matter at hand, when accident is proffered as the explanation for a death, the state-of-mind hearsay exception has been used to admit testimony about a decedent’s prior statements. In United States v. Brown, 490 F.2d 758, 767 (D.C.Cir.1973), the D.C. Circuit observed that “courts have developed three rather well-defined categories in which the need for [state-of-mind evidence] overcomes almost any possible prejudice”: (1) when a defendant is claiming self-defense; (2) when a defendant proffers a defense on the ground that the deceased committed suicide; and, of relevance to the present appeal, (3) when a defendant claims that there was an accidental death. Although finding undue prejudice in the statements in issue before the court, the Brown panel noted that this type of state-of-mind testimony possesses a “significant degree of relevance.” Ibid. Indeed, it is generally accepted that “such statements are admissible where the defense claims self-defense, suicide, or accidental death because in each of those situations the statements look to the future in that decedent’s fear makes unlikely and thus helps to rebut defense claims about the decedent’s subsequent conduct.” 2 McCormick on Evidence § 276 at 403-04 (Broun ed., 7th ed.2013).\nCourts in other jurisdictions similarly recognize that a homicide victim’s prior statements of fear of a defendant are both relevant and admissible — through state-of-mind testimony â if the defendant in the case is claiming that an accident occurred. See, e.g., Jones v. United States, 398 A.2d 11, 12-13 (D.C.1979) (finding state-of-mind testimony to be admissible where defendant claimed victim accidentally fell down stairs); State v. Richards, 552 N.W.2d 197, 209 (Minn.1996) (finding that, because defendant raised accident and/or suicide as defense to homicide charge, victim’s state of mind was relevant and trial court did not err in admitting state-of-mind testimony); State v. Crawford, 344 N.C. 65, 472 S.E. 2d 920, 927 (1996) (concluding that victim’s state of mind was relevant “to the issues involved in the instant ease, including explaining and refuting defendant’s claims of self-defense and accident”); State v. Aesoph, 647 N.W.2d 743, 757 (S.D.2002) (finding victim’s state-of-mind testimony was admissible and noting that “it is well understood that a murder victim’s statements, regarding fear of the accused, are admissible to rebut a defendant’s claim of accidental death” (citations omitted)); Clay v. Commonwealth, 262 Va. 253, 546 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001) (determining that trial court committed no abuse of discretion in admitting victim’s statements regarding fear of accused because defendant claimed victim’s death was accidental and because victim’s statements were relevant and probative of whether accidental nature of death was likely).\nThis is the first case in which we are squarely in a position to pass on whether state-of-mind hearsay may be admitted to rebut a defense that the victim’s death was accidental. Our case law previously suggested that it was admissible; we now hold that state-of-mind hearsay statements by a deceased about fear of a defendant, who later advances in his or her defense in a homicide prosecution a claim that the victim’s death was accidental, are admissible for the purpose of proving the declarant’s state of mind under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(3). Such evidence is relevant when the door is opened by the defense, as occurred here by defendant’s advancement of accident as the cause of Jody’s death under unusual circumstances. Having determined that state-of-mind evidence about the victim is relevant when an accidental-death theory is advanced by defendant, we turn to assess whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.\nrv.\nA.\nEvidentiary rulings made by the trial court are reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Hisenaj v. Kuehner, 194 N.J. 6, 12, 942 A.2d 769 (2008). To that end, trial courts are granted broad discretion in making decisions regarding evidentiary matters, such as whether a piece of evidence is relevant, see Green v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., 160 N.J. 480, 492, 734 A.2d 1147 (1999), and whether a particular hearsay statement is admissible under an appropriate exception, see State v. Buda, 195 N.J. 278, 294-95, 949 A.2d 761 (2008).\nIn pretrial argument before the trial court, the defense conceded that state-of-mind evidence “may be probative” when accident is the defense and focused its attack about admissibility on the volume of statements that the State sought to introduce and the good faith of Jody’s statements when made. Responding to the arguments advanced pretrial, the trial court assessed the voluntarily reduced list of witnesses from whom the State sought to elicit the state-of-mind hearsay statements of the deceased and concluded that they were relevant for the singular purpose of the jury’s assessment of Jody’s state of mind and how that related to the issues to be decided in this homicide case. Specifically, the court determined to allow testimony from six witnesses (although only five actually testified) about Jody’s statements expressed shortly before her death and during the time when she was moving forward with her divorce action by having it filed and served on defendant. The court emphasized the statements’ temporal proximity both to the actions unfolding regarding the divorce and the date of Jody’s death. The court concluded that the statements were rendered close enough in time to enhance their probative value and provide a direct counter to defendant’s narrative that this was all just an accidental death. Without expressing it precisely in terms of good faith, the court found the statements sufficiently reliable to put them before the jury for their assessment for that limited purpose.\nThe court was specific in what it was allowing: statements of fear of defendant; statements about defendant’s abusive conduct toward her, but not specific acts; statements about her fear of heights; and statements about her intent to continue with the divorce action she initiated. On the matter of defendant’s abuse, the court cautioned that it was allowing limited reference to alleged domestic violence and only for the “singular purpose” of showing Jody’s state of mind. Thus, it would allow the jury to weigh those statements against defendant’s counter narrative that Jody willingly went with defendant, whom she was divorcing, to an isolated and dangerous spot where she allegedly accidentally fell to her death. It bears repeating that defendant asserted that the cliffs were “their spot,” that he and Jody might have reconciled and not divorced, and that amorous activities were still, at that time, possible between them.\nIndeed, concerning Teague’s proffered testimony that Jody told her in a therapy session that she had never gone to the cliffs with defendant and that she had recently turned down his request that she go there with him, the court noted the highly relevant nature of that evidence to paint a picture of the general relationship between defendant and Jody shortly before the events of the evening of September 20, 1992 took place. Plainly regarding that statement as intrinsic to the relationship “mosaic” that both parties to the case would be presenting, the court determined to allow Jody’s statements, all of which were close in time to the event of her death.\nImportantly, the court expressly stated that it would not permit any of the testimony to be used to prove defendant’s motivation or conduct. The statements could be used to show only Jody’s state of mind, and that use was deemed permissible by the court because only her words were available to speak for her about the likelihood that she acted as defendant asserted.\nBased on the argument advanced pretrial, we find no error in the trial court’s admissibility determination. The testimony about Jody’s oral statements reflective of her state of mind was relevant because defendant opened the door to it by arguing that an accidental death occurred here. Defendant’s argument pretrial did not more specifically focus on the content of Jody’s out-of-court state-of-mind statements.\nOn appeal, defendant argues that this state-of-mind evidence could not possibly assist in the important assessment of whether defendant killed with the requisite state of mind and therefore its relevance was overvalued by the trial court. We reject that argument. It is too limiting a frame for the admissibility determination we review. Whether Jody would have gone alone with defendant, willingly, anywhere, let alone to an isolated place, at night, on the cliffs, where she said she had never been and would not go when asked before, makes this evidence highly probative of her state of mind. It was relevant to disputed, material factual issues about Jody’s state of mind toward defendant, about her marital relationship, and about her likely conduct that were ultimately argued in this trial where the defense was accidental death. In conclusion, we find no abuse of discretion in the court’s determination not to grant defendant’s motion to exclude the evidence for the reasons advanced.\nB.\nTurning to how the statements were handled at trial when admitted during the presentation of the testimony, we again view those statements from the trial court’s vantage point because we review the court’s admission of hearsay statements under an abuse-of-discretion standard. See Buda, supra, 195 N.J. at 295, 949 A.2d 761 (noting that “[o]ur review of these evidentiary determinations likewise is limited to determining whether the trial court’s decisions ... constituted an abuse of discretion”). Therefore, we examine the arguments, and objections, if any, when made before the trial court as the evidence was presented. See id. at 294-95, 949 A.2d 761.\nNotably, the defense raised no objection to the admission of the statements of M.H., Teague, or M.G. There was not a single objection to the content of the testimony of those first three witnesses. Nor did counsel request or suggest any limiting instruction at the time. Instead, the defense mounted an objection to the cumulative nature of the two remaining witnesses when M.D. was about to testify (A.R. followed M.D. and was the last witness presented by the State on this subject). The court preliminarily accepted the State’s argument that it was entitled to bring in testimony from the perspective of people who interacted with Jody from different parts of her life, said “let’s see what they say,” and informed defense counsel that it would permit further objections. No specific objection came during any point in M.D.’s testimony.\nJust prior to A.R.’s testimony, counsel stated he was continuing his objection based on the cumulative nature of the testimony as was argued at sidebar, but there was no objection to any specific part of A.R.’s testimony, just as there had been none to M.D.’s testimony.\nWe recognize the hesitancy that a trial court might have with interjecting in this testimony when defense counsel did not object to any specific piece of the testimony by those witnesses and who was himself actively questioning the witnesses about Jody’s statements on cross-examination. Concerning the cumulative-testimony general objection, we note that M.D.’s testimony took up only twelve pages and A.R.’s ten pages in the transcript. That included their direct and cross-examination. Plainly, these witnesses were the tail of this testimony and we view it from the vantage point of the trial court as the testimony unfolded. That day, the State had presented a total of five witnesses. The first two, M.H. and Teague, were by far the longest, with M.G. trailing far behind in length. Not until the short presentations of M.D. and A.R. did the court confront an objection. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial judge who sat through that day of testimony and reacted fairly to the parties’ arguments about the remaining two witnesses. Overall, the objected-to testimony was brief, covered some different ground, and was not cumulative to the point of being erroneously admitted. We determine that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court.\nV.\nOn appeal, defendant advanced arguments not presented to the trial court. Defendant argued that the prejudicial content of the phraseology of the utterances by Jody, as testified to by the witnesses, should have required their exclusion. According to defendant, their admission rendered the conviction reversible as a matter of plain error. Defendant also contended that the trial court’s instructions to the jury on the use of the state-of-mind evidence were inadequate.\nA.\nGenerally, arguments about the prejudicial nature of individual statements should have been made to the trial court. See State v. Robinson, 200 N.J. 1, 19, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009) (“The jurisdiction of appellate courts rightly is bounded by the proofs and objections critically explored on the record before the trial court by the parties themselves.”). An appellate court is better positioned to reviewing evidential arguments first presented to the trial court.\nThat said, on the merits of defendant’s arguments, the statements of Jody’s fear of defendant and of her fear of violence by defendant were plainly prejudicial to defendant because they conveyed unfavorable information about defendant, as perceived by Jody. There was testimony repeating numerous statements by Jody about her fear of defendant, several about her fear of violence by defendant, and even testimony that she feared that he would kill her. The quantity and quality of some of those statements give us pause. The better practice here would have been for the trial court to have limited the amount and content of the state-of-mind testimony elicited through the witnesses.\nBut the admitted statements clearly were relevant for rebutting defendant’s claim about how he and Jody were interacting at the point in time that she ended up one evening on a remote cliff on the Palisades with defendant when she was pursuing a divorce action against him and was requesting friends to let her know if he came around places she frequented looking for her. The hearsay statements were directly relevant and were of assistance to the jury in its assessment of the likelihood that Jody would have voluntarily accompanied defendant to the edge of a cliff for a romantic interlude. This was classic state-of-mind evidence used to counter an accidental-death defense to a charge of homicide. Cf. Aesoph, supra, 647 N.W.2d at 748, 755-57 (finding that state-of-mind hearsay testimony of defendant’s deceased wife, who was divorcing him and had fled home, that she feared violence by defendant was admissible in rebuttal of defendant’s claim of accidental death); see generally 2 McCormick on Evidence, supra, § 276 at 403-04 (stating that state-of-mind testimony is admissible to rebut defense of accident because statements rebut defendant’s claims about decedent’s conduct).\nThe evidence of the five witnesses was not an overriding part of the State’s presentation. The five witnesses completed all their testimony in a single day of this long, multi-day trial. The great bulk of the State’s case, presented over the many days, focused on the investigation and the forensic evidence regarding the scientific unlikelihood that Jody could have accidentally fallen forward off the cliff and landed as she did with the injuries she sustained. And, the State painstakingly brought out defendant’s many inconsistent statements, including his differing versions of how the fall occurred. The jury was told by the court to use those statements only for the purpose of understanding Jody’s state of mind. In reviewing the arguments of the parties, there was no suggestion made to the jury to use the evidence in any other way or for any other purpose. Moreover, the State’s summation did not dwell on Jody’s statements, but rather emphasized the forensic evidence and defendant’s actions and his inconsistent statements. The State used the forensic evidence in summation to show the implausibility that Jody could have simply fallen from the cliff and landed where her body was found. Thus, although the testimony included repeated statements by Jody about her fear of defendant, we do not perceive the content of the evidence admitted to constitute plain error requiring reversal of this conviction.\nNor do we find plain error in the instruction provided by the court to the jury, although we have more to say about instructing the jury in these settings. To the extent that defendant attacks the adequacy of the trial court’s limiting instruction on the use of that evidence, we make the following observations.\nFirst, the defense’s few objections during the eliciting of the testimony went only to the asserted cumulative nature of the evidence. At no point during the presentation of the witnesses did counsel propose instructing the jury at that time on the use of the testimony.\nSecond, it bears recalling that when the trial court ruled pretrial that the state-of-mind evidence would not be excluded, it instructed counsel to prepare and submit language to properly instruct the jury about the evidence’s use. None was forthcoming during the trial apparently.\nThird, the issue of a limiting instruction finally came up during the charge conference. The transcript of the charge conference demonstrates that the State offered proposed language on the permissible use of the state-of-mind evidence. The defense reacted to that proposal, requesting removal of any proposed use other than to show the victim’s state of mind. After a pointed exchange between counsel, the court reserved on the question. The charge ultimately provided was limited to what the defense requested be given. In light of the manner in which the trial court solicited input on an instruction to the jury, and engaged with counsel over a proper limiting instruction, the result here was a negotiated jury charge that we cannot say caused defendant’s trial to be unjust.\nB.\nHaving addressed the arguments raised in this matter, we would be remiss were we not to highlight our concern about dangers associated with use of state-of-mind testimony about a declarant’s fear of a defendant.\nTestimony about a decedent’s stated fear of the defendant and, more pointedly, a decedent’s stated fear of violence at the hands of the defendant, is powerful evidence. It clearly carries prejudicial impact for the defendant but the question is whether it is unfairly prejudicial. See N.J.R.E. 403. For that very reason, many courts evaluating the proper use of such state-of-mind evidence have recognized that, even if the proposed testimony is admissible as relevant evidence under the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule, it can be subject to exclusion if its relevance is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See State v. Bauer, 598 N.W.2d 352, 367 (Minn.1999), overruled on other grounds by, State v. McCoy, 682 N.W.2d 153, 160 n.6 (Minn.2004); Campbell v. United States, 391 A.2d 283, 287 (D.C.App.1978).\nWe share the concern of courts in sister jurisdictions about the need to take great care with such perilous evidence. Care must be taken to guard against undue prejudice and the risk that the jury may misuse the evidence.\nAccordingly, to address our concern about proper use of state-of-mind hearsay evidence of a homicide victim’s fear of a defendant, and especially the victim’s statements of fear of violence by the defendant, we shall impose on trial courts, as gatekeepers to the admissibility of such evidence, the obligation to perform an express Rule 403 weighing of evidence in addition to an assessment for relevance of the victim’s state-of-mind testimony under Rule 803(c)(3). A weighing for undue prejudice should follow a review for relevance under Rule 803(c)(3). In addition to the court’s ability to exclude such evidence, the trial court should consider limiting its amount, including redacting or sanitizing it as the court determines appropriate, to balance the interests of the proponent of the testimony and that of the party against whom it is used. For example, a court might allow the jury to hear relevant evidence about the victim’s “fear” of a defendant but might redact more prejudicial parts of a victim’s statement that she feared death at the hands of the defendant. The latter part adds little of relevance and can be unduly prejudicial. The sheer force of the latter type of statement suggests that because the victim thought the defendant would kill her, he must have done so — which is not a permissible inference.\nFurther, a proper limiting instruction is necessary. “It is the independent duty of the court to ensure that the jurors receive accurate instructions on the law as it pertains to the facts and issues of each ease, irrespective of the particular language suggested by either party.” State v. Reddish, 181 N.J. 553, 613, 859 A.2d 1173 (2004) (citing State v. Thompson, 59 N.J. 396, 411, 283 A.2d 513 (1971)). Indeed, “[i]t is difficult to overstate the importance of jury instructions” as “[appropriate and proper charges are essential for a fair trial.” Ibid, (quoting State v. Green, 86 N.J. 281, 287, 430 A.2d 914 (1981)); see also State v. Baum, 224 N.J. 147, 159, 129 A.3d 1044 (2016).\nA limiting instruction is required here to guard against the risk that the jury will consider the victim’s statements of fear as evidence of the defendant’s intent or actions. See Calleia, supra, 206 N.J. at 292, 20 A.3d 402. Such state-of-mind testimony may properly be used only for evaluating the victim’s actions or the likelihood of him or her acting in a certain way. Id. at 296, 20 A.3d 402. The evidence is relevant, as it was in this case, for assessing the likelihood of the victim’s actions when the jury considers the defense of accidental death proffered in a homicide prosecution. However, the evidence may not be used as evidence of the defendant’s actions or intent. Id. at 292, 20 A.3d 402. Through a limiting instruction, the jury should be told the permissible and prohibited purposes of the evidence. Cf. State v. Cofield, 127 N.J. 328, 341, 605 A.2d 230 (1992).\nIn light of those concerns, the better practice to be followed, whether requested or not, is to tailor the charge on how to use the state-of-mind evidence to the facts and to tell the jury how the evidence may be used and how it may not be used. For example, the court here could have told the jury that the state-of-mind evidence — Jody’s fear of defendant — was relevant to the issue of whether Jody voluntarily went to the edge of a cliff with defendant. State-of-mind evidence bears on how Jody likely acted on the night of her death. Ultimately, the inferences concerning how Jody’s state of mind affected her conduct were for the jury to draw. Moreover, to deflect risk that the jury might misperceive the limited use to which it may put such evidence, a limiting instruction should be provided at the time the evidence is presented, as well as at the close of the evidence when the jury charge is delivered prior to deliberations. See State v. Winder, 200 N.J. 231, 256, 979 A.2d 312 (2009) (noting importance of “prompt” limiting instruction at time evidence is admitted in addition to at time of closing instruction); State v. Lykes, 192 N.J. 519, 537, 933 A.2d 1274 (2007) (noting same). The pointed and immediate direction to the jury as to the limited permissible use of such evidence will protect defendants while underscoring for the proponent of the testimony the permissible use for which it is advanced.\nVI.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed. The matter is remanded for consideration of defendant’s unaddressed appellate arguments.\nChief Justice RABNER; Justices ALBIN, FERNANDEZ-VINA and SOLOMON; and Judge CUFF (temporarily assigned) join in Justice LaVECCHIA’s opinion. Justice PATTERSON did not participate.\nTo place the legal issue in context, we summarize the facts as they were presented during the trial. Because the murder for which defendant was convicted occurred in 1992 and the trial took place in 2011, the proceedings that explain that delay are also recounted.\nDefense counsel pointed out inconsistencies between Jonathan's testimony on direct examination and his statements to police shortly after defendant was arrested. Jonathan explained those inconsistencies by admitting that he was afraid of his father and held back in his second interview, even though he was an adult at the time. Jonathan stated that he was concerned that defendant might try to harm Jonathan's wife and that he wanted to be sure defendant was in custody before he disclosed some of the events about which he testified.\nExamination of the record reveals that, in July, Jody had filed for divorce but that the papers had not yet been served on defendant. The papers were served in September, shortly before her death.\nWe reject the argument that Teague could not testify to statements made by Jody during her counseling sessions with her because the defense asserts that the statements were not for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. As the Stale properly argued, these statements were admissible as having been obtained as part of Teague's process of diagnosing the root causes of Jody's depressive feelings for which she was administering professional care and treatment to Jody. See N.J.R.E. 803(c)(4); see also R.S. v. Knighton, 125 N.J. 79, 88, 592 A.2d 1157 (1991) (observing that, \"when the cause of a symptom, pain, or physical sensation is relevant to diagnosis and treatment, courts will admit the statement”). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's admission of Teague’s testimony.",

Defendant's motion to dissolve the FRO was denied because it did not include a transcript of the underlying 2004 FRO hearing, even though the audio record of that proceeding apparently is not capable of transcription. We reverse and remand for the Family Part to verify the unavailability of the audio record of the FRO hearing, to determine whether defendant has shown prima facie evidence of changed circumstances to dissolve the FRO, and unless she has not met this burden, to reconstruct the record of the FRO hearing consistent with the procedures of this opinion.\nI\nThe parties divorced in March 2004 after a ten-year marriage. Of their three children, one is emancipated, one is in college and one is a teenager, who resides with defendant. Plaintiff moved to Florida and remarried in 2014.\nIn August 2004, plaintiff obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) under the Act against defendant, alleging as a predicate offense that defendant was harassing him. Plaintiff's complaint stated that defendant made \"repeated calls to [plaintiff] and others\" that were \"harassing and threatening,\" causing him fear. She repeatedly called plaintiff's girlfriend.\nPlaintiff also claimed, in the original request for a restraining order, that defendant had a history of committing acts of domestic violence against him. He accused defendant of coming into the house and taking items belonging to the children; asserting in vulgar language her claim to ownership of the house; demanding that plaintiff move into the laundry room; stabbing him in the arm; running after him with two butcher knives; locking him out of the house in cold weather when he was scheduled for tests on his heart; keeping him up by flashing lights; chasing and hitting him with a battery charger while disparaging him with coarse language; threatening to run her car off the road while he was a passenger; hitting him in the head with a tripod; locking him out of the house with the cat; and kicking him in the ribs, legs, and chest, spitting in his face, and calling him a \"f**king loser\" and \"piece of s**t.\"\nThe FRO entered on August 18, 2004 by Judge John B. Dangler provided that defendant committed \"an act of domestic violence.\" It restrained defendant from contacting plaintiff's girlfriend, her employer, and plaintiff's brother and sister-in-law. Her communication with plaintiff was to be limited to non-harassing/non-abusive parenting issues concerning the children. The court also ordered defendant to have a mental health assessment. Defendant did not appeal the FRO.\nIn March 2016, defendant made application pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d) to dissolve the FRO, alleging a \"substantial change of circumstances\" since its entry nearly twelve years earlier in 2004. In her supporting certification, defendant alleged the FRO should be dissolved to permit the parties to mediate a new parenting time schedule. She alleged the FRO posed a hardship to her in obtaining other employment. Other changed circumstances since 2004 included plaintiff's move to Florida and the support of his former girlfriend to vacate the FRO.\nDefendant claimed that plaintiff no longer feared her. She alleged that in 2006, they shared a hotel room for a week with their children while at a tournament in Florida. They also entered into a real estate joint venture. According to defendant, plaintiff attended her fortieth birthday party in 2008 at his restaurant, and he stayed with the children and her parents in Hilton Head. She claimed he made sexual advances to her. With respect to his current wife, defendant claims they communicated cordially at least until 2014 and 2015 when defendant filed post-judgment matrimonial orders to show cause, accusing plaintiff of taking their teenaged son to Florida for spring break and not timely returning him.\nDefendant's application to dissolve the FRO did not include the transcript of the 2004 FRO hearing. By way of explanation, defendant attached a copy of an e-mail from the Morris County Superior Court Operations Division that stated, \"neither tape is working, so there is nothing for you to listen to.\" A later e-mail reported that \"it was discovered that one of the tapes was blank,\" but there was a second half with the judge's decision. A May 4, 2016 certification from a tape transcript processing employee in the Morris County vicinage stated that the audio tapes of the 2004 FRO hearing were blank.\nPlaintiff \"strongly\" opposed the dissolution of the FRO and filed a cross-motion for attorney's fees. In his certification, plaintiff alleged defendant was \"violent, irrational, and mentally unstable.\" He remained \"extremely fearful of [her] and very concerned about [his] safety and security\" should the FRO be dissolved. He denied sharing a hotel room with defendant and the children, hosting a birthday party for her, staying at Hilton Head with her parents, or making sexual advances. He emphasized that the real estate investment in 2006 was conducted through an attorney. Plaintiff claimed that in 2014, defendant called the former spouse of his current wife (Rhonda) and made spurious accusations concerning his interactions with the children and his relationship with Rhonda. Plaintiff also rejected any proposal to mediate parenting time issues. The parties had been in court in 2014, 2015 and 2016 on multiple post-judgment matrimonial motions concerning parenting time with their teenaged son and other related matters.\nIn an order dated May 6, 2016, the Family Part denied defendant's application to dissolve the FRO because it did not include a copy of the 2004 FRO hearing transcript. The court based its ruling on the plain language in N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d), which requires a \"complete record of the hearing\" before dissolving or modifying any final order. The Family Part also expressly relied on this court's decision in Kanaszka v. Kunen, 313 N.J. Super. 600, 713 A.2d 565 (App. Div. 1998), which held:\nIn cases where the motion judge did not enter the final restraining order, we hold the \"complete record\" requirement of the statute includes, at a minimum, all pleadings and orders, the court file, and a complete transcript of the final restraining order hearing. Without the ability to review the transcript, the motion judge is unable to properly evaluate the application for dismissal.\n[ Id. at 606, 713 A.2d 565.]\nNoting that defendant had the burden of proof and the primary goal of the Act was to protect victims of domestic violence, the Family Part ruled that defendant's application had a \"procedurally ... fatal defect\" without the transcript. The court dismissed defendant's application without prejudice, concluding it was \"prohibited\" from determining the merits of the application without the transcript of the FRO hearing.\nIn an order dated June 10, 2016, the court denied defendant's application for reconsideration. In its written statement of reasons, the court noted defendant did not allege any new facts warranting reconsideration. Without the transcript, it had \"almost no record on which to rely\" in analyzing whether plaintiff had an objective fear of defendant or whether any of the factors set forth in Carfagno v. Carfagno, for determining if good cause had been shown, were present. The court stated that the FRO did not \"state the underlying predicate act\" and certifications from the parties did not \"illuminate details of the underlying incident of domestic violence.\"\nBy weighing the various interests, the Family Part rejected defendant's contention, both facially and as applied, that she was deprived of due process by being \"unable to proceed past the pleading stage.\" Plaintiff's private interest in retaining the FRO weighed more heavily than defendant's interest in dissolving the FRO because the necessity for the transcript was \"to inform any future judge of the underlying events.\" The risk of erroneous deprivation inured to both parties, but the lack of a transcript could \"severely prejudice ... [p]laintiff\" because the domestic violence evidence might be stale or witnesses might be lost. Given the State's interest in protecting its citizens who are victims of domestic violence, the Act provided only \"narrow circumstances\" to dissolve the restraints. The Family Part did not address defendant's request to reconstruct the FRO hearing record, which she raised for the first time in her motion for reconsideration. On appeal, defendant contends the court erred by not allowing the 2004 FRO record to be reconstructed so that her application to dissolve the FRO could be heard. At the oral argument of the appeal, defendant's counsel suggested a two-step hearing process where the court would first reconstruct the record of the FRO and then would address the merits of the application to dismiss the restraints. Plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct to deny the application because a transcript was required. Plaintiff suggests that defendant's relief must come from the Legislature by way of an amendment of the Act.\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude that fundamental fairness and due process of law require the Family Part to confer with the parties and reconstruct the record of the FRO hearing. We thus reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nII\nWe accord \"great deference to discretionary decisions of Family Part judges,\" Milne v. Goldenberg, 428 N.J. Super. 184, 197, 51 A.3d 161 (App. Div. 2012), in recognition of the \"family courts' special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters.\" N.J. Div. of Youth and Family Servs. v. M.C. III, 201 N.J. 328, 343, 990 A.2d 1097 (2010) (quoting Cesare v. Cesare, 154 N.J. 394, 413, 713 A.2d 390 (1998) ). We are mindful of the deference owed to determinations made by family judges who hear domestic violence cases. See Cesare, 154 N.J. at 411-12, 713 A.2d 390. \"[F]indings by the trial court are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\" Ibid. (citing Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Inv'rs Ins. Co., 65 N.J. 474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974) ). However, \"[a] trial court's interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\" Hitesman v. Bridgeway, Inc., 218 N.J. 8, 26, 93 A.3d 306 (2014) (quoting Manalapan Realty, LP v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, 140 N.J. 366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) ).\nThe Legislature intended that the Act \"assure the victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse the law can provide.\" State v. Brown, 394 N.J. Super. 492, 504, 927 A.2d 569 (App. Div. 2007) (quoting N.J.S.A. 2C:25-18 ).\nIt is the responsibility of the courts to protect victims of violence that occurs in a family or family-like setting by providing access to both emergent and long-term civil and criminal remedies and sanctions, and by ordering those remedies and sanctions that are available to assure the safety of the victims and the public.\n[ N.J.S.A. 2C:25-18.]\nThe entry of a domestic violence restraining order requires a trial court to make certain findings. See Silver v. Silver, 387 N.J. Super. 112, 125-26, 903 A.2d 446 (App. Div. 2006). The court \"must determine whether the plaintiff has proven, by a preponderance of the credible evidence, that one or more of the predicate acts set forth in N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19(a) has occurred.\" Id. at 125, 903 A.2d 446. The court should make this determination \"in light of the previous history of violence between the parties.\" Ibid. (quoting Cesare, 154 N.J. at 402, 713 A.2d 390 ).\nNext, the court must determine whether a restraining order is required to protect the party seeking restraints from future acts or threats of violence. Silver, 387 N.J. Super. at 126-27, 903 A.2d 446. That means, \"there [must] be a finding that 'relief is necessary to prevent further abuse.' \" J.D. v. M.D.F., 207 N.J. 458, 476, 25 A.3d 1045 (2011) (quoting N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(b) ).\nA final restraining order under the Act can be modified or dissolved only by court order upon a showing of good cause. T.M.S. v. W.C.P., 450 N.J. Super. at 502, 163 A.3d 929. N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d) provides,\nUpon good cause shown, any final order may be dissolved or modified upon application to the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court, but only if the judge who dissolves or modifies the order is the same judge who entered the order, or has available a complete record of the hearing or hearings on which the order was based.\n[ N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d).]\nThe party asking to modify or dissolve the FRO has the \"burden to make a prima facie showing [that] good cause exists for dissolution of the restraining order prior to the judge fully considering the application for dismissal.\" Kanaszka, 313 N.J. Super. at 608, 713 A.2d 565. That party must show \"substantial changes in the circumstances\" from what existed at the final hearing for the court to \"entertain the application for dismissal\" in order that the victim is not \"forced to repeatedly relitigate issues with the perpetrator, as that itself can constitute a form of abusive and controlling behavior.\" Ibid. A plenary hearing should only be ordered where this burden is met and there are \"facts in dispute material to a resolution of the motion .... Conclusory allegations should be disregarded.\" Ibid. (citing Lepis v. Lepis, 83 N.J. 139, 159, 416 A.2d 45 (1980) ).\nIn evaluating whether good cause has been shown under the statute to modify or dissolve a final order, a court is to consider the non-exclusive list of factors set forth in Carfagno, 288 N.J. Super. at 435, 672 A.2d 751. These include,\n(1) whether the victim consented to lift the restraining order; (2) whether the victim fears the defendant; (3) the nature of the relationship between the parties today; (4) the number of times that the defendant has been convicted of contempt for violating the order; (5) whether the defendant has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse; (6) whether the defendant has been involved in other violent acts with other persons; (7) whether the defendant has engaged in counseling; (8) the age and health of the defendant; (9) whether the victim is acting in good faith when opposing the defendant's request; (10) whether another jurisdiction has entered a restraining order protecting the victim from the defendant; and (11) other factors deemed relevant by the court.\nIn Kanaszka, we held that the parties' history of domestic violence is to be considered to evaluate the victim's continued fear of the perpetrator and that this \"may include exploration of incidents that were not testified to at the final hearing.\" 313 N.J. Super. at 607, 713 A.2d 565.\nThe parties in Kanaszka had a dating relationship when the plaintiff applied for a restraining order based on the defendant's \"assaultive and threatening conduct.\" Id. at 604, 713 A.2d 565. Two years later, the defendant filed a motion to dissolve the restraining order because he wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement, asserting he could not do so because of the FRO. There were no violations of the FRO but the plaintiff opposed the motion, alleging she still had fear of the defendant and remained in counseling. She detailed the allegations of abuse.\nThe defendant's motion in Kanaszka did not include a transcript of the FRO hearing, although there was no indication that it was unavailable. In that context, we noted that the court \"must carefully scrutinize the record and carefully consider the totality of the circumstances before removing the protective shield.\" Id. at 605, 713 A.2d 565. The parties disputed the nature of their relationship and provided conflicting accounts of the events that led the court to issue the FRO. In this light, we held that,\nwhere the motion judge did not enter the final restraining order, ... the \"complete record\" requirement of the statute includes, at a minimum, all pleadings and orders, the court file, and a complete transcript of the final restraining order hearing. Without the ability to review the transcript, the motion judge is unable to properly evaluate the application for dismissal. Moreover, in view of the significant volume of cases handled by Family Part judges, even if the motion was heard by [the original judge], we believe it would be difficult for the judge to give due consideration to the motion without the benefit of a transcript, as more than [seventeen] months had elapsed since the final hearing. In most instances, the better practice is for a transcript to accompany the motion for dissolution of a final restraining order to enable the motion judge to fully understand the totality of the circumstances and dynamics of the relationship and application.\n[ Id. at 606-07, 713 A.2d 565.]\nWe considered the defendant's failure to include the transcript as \"fatal to his appeal,\" denying it without prejudice. We added that even with the full record, the Carfagno factors should be considered in determining whether the movant had shown a prima facie case of changed circumstances to dissolve the restraints.\nHere, defendant contends the transcript cannot be produced at all. Defendant argues that the Family Part misconstrued our holding in Kanaszka as creating an absolute, inflexible rule, requiring an applicant seeking the dissolution or modification of a FRO to submit a transcript of the FRO hearing, regardless of whether such a transcript is not available through no fault of the applicant. According to defendant, such an approach not only denies her a right the Legislature expressly provided in N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d), but permanently bars her from obtaining any relief, regardless of whether changes in circumstances warrant it. Defendant argues this outcome could have been avoided if the Family Part had reconstructed the record of the FRO hearing, as authorized under Rule 2:5-3(f).\nRule 2:5-3(f) is an appellate rule that provides \"[i]f a verbatim record made of the proceedings has been lost, destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the court or agency from which the appeal is taken shall supervise the reconstruction of the record. The reconstruction may be in the form of a statement of proceedings in lieu of a transcript.\" (Emphasis added). Defendant appeals orders from the 2016 \"proceedings\" that denied her motion to dismiss the FRO, but those records are not lost. Rule 2:5-3(f)'s reference to \"proceedings\" is not applicable to the 2004 FRO hearing record.\nThat said, we agree that in other contexts, we have held due process requires a judge to reconstruct the record. In State v. Izaguirre, 272 N.J. Super. 51, 639 A.2d 343 (App. Div. 1994), the stenographic notes of a murder trial were inadvertently destroyed shortly after the trial. The trial judge developed a plan for reconstructing the record with the cooperation of both counsel. In Izaguirre, we held that where the record of the trial is needed for appeal or \"other valid purpose\" and has been lost accidentally, \"it becomes the duty of the trial court as a matter of due process entitlement of the parties to reconstruct the record in a manner that, considering the actual circumstances, provides reasonable assurances of accuracy and completeness.\" Id. at 56, 639 A.2d 343 ; accord State v. Thompson, 405 N.J. Super. 163, 963 A.2d 884 (App. Div. 2009) ; State v. Bishop, 350 N.J. Super. 335, 795 A.2d 297 (App. Div. 2002) (stating it is the duty of the trial judge as a matter of due process to reconstruct the record in a manner sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of accuracy and completeness); see also State v. Casimono, 298 N.J. Super. 22, 688 A.2d 1093 (App. Div. 1997) (where we were not assured of the accuracy or completeness of the transcript because the trial court reconstructed the record without input from the parties).\nHere, the trial court denied defendant's motion for reconsideration without considering the alternative approach we suggested in Izaguirre. By so doing, the Family Part did not give due consideration to defendant's due process rights. In fact, the court did not even mention defendants request to reconstruct the record in its statement of reasons, denying the motion for reconsideration. In addressing whether judges should reconstruct the record in this context, we are mindful of the Act's purpose to protect victims of domestic violence. We are equally aware of the potential for misuse of the judicial process when victims of domestic violence are required to appear in court or otherwise respond through counsel and the expenditure of attorney's fees associated with such a process. We also are acutely aware that the process of reconstructing the record can be an arduous one that is fraught with difficulties because witnesses or documents may no longer be available.\nOf equal importance is the danger that one of the parties will use the opportunity as a means to relitigate the FRO hearing. However, we are satisfied that by including in the Act that an FRO can be dissolved or modified for good cause, the Legislature did not intend to close the courtroom doors to applicants forever merely because the court no longer has a record that can be used to transcribe the FRO proceedings. Due process requires reconstruction of the record in certain circumstances. To guide the courts when confronted with the absence of the transcript in this context, we set forth the following procedures.\nWhere the transcript is available but simply has not been included by the party seeking relief, we continue to subscribe to the approach adopted in Kanaszka. This omission is fatal and the application should be denied without prejudice to allow the applicant to cure this deficiency by obtaining and submitting a complete transcript of the FRO proceeding. However, if the moving party has documentation from the judiciary that the proceeding cannot be transcribed in whole or in part, the court must then determine if this problem was caused by the applicant. In this regard, we do not consider the applicant here to be at fault merely because she did not appeal the FRO or request the transcript shortly after the hearing. The court must determine whether the transcript is in fact completely unavailable or whether it may be retrievable through Court Smart.\nIf there is no audio recording to transcribe or if the recording has been corrupted, preventing its transcription in whole or in part, and the applicant was not the cause of this malfunction, the court must then determine if the applicant can produce evidence to establish a prima facie case that changed circumstances exist to modify or dissolve the FRO in the absence of a transcript. The court should also determine whether the judge who heard the FRO issued detailed findings in a statement of reasons, which would allow the court to conclude that the record is complete and that the moving party did not show prima facie evidence of changed circumstances to dissolve the restraints. The court file may have sufficient information to determine that the moving party has not met its burden of showing changed circumstances. Prima facie evidence includes consideration of the Carfagno factors.\nIf however, the court cannot assess whether to deny the application or is otherwise satisfied that, based on the record before it, the applicant presented a prima facie showing of changed circumstances, the court should reconstruct the record of the FRO hearing. If the parties are represented by counsel, they may be able to stipulate the core salient facts that formed the basis for the issuance of the FRO. The guiding principle is to produce a record that \"provides reasonable assurances of accuracy and completeness.\" Izaguirre, 272 N.J. Super. at 57, 639 A.2d 343. If one or more of the parties is appearing pro se, the court should attempt to reconstruct the record by questioning the parties under oath to determine whether what occurred at the FRO hearing can be reasonably and reliably reconstructed. We leave to the discretion of the judge whether to permit pro se litigants to submit a written, sworn account of what occurred at the FRO hearing in lieu of providing an oral account which can be transcribed and made available to us for appellate review.\nOnce the record of the FRO proceeding has been reconstructed, the court must determine whether the applicant has presented sufficient evidence to establish good cause to modify or dissolve the FRO. N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d). The Family Part judge retains the discretion to determine whether this determination requires a plenary hearing. As we made clear in Kanaszka, the applicant \"has the burden to make a prima facie showing good cause exists for dissolution of the restraining order prior to the judge fully considering the application for dismissal.\" 313 N.J. Super. at 608, 713 A.2d 565 (emphasis added).\nIf the judge is satisfied that reconstruction of the record is not feasible, the judge must make specific findings describing the reasons for this conclusion. In such a case, we hold that where a party requesting to modify or dissolve a FRO has shown prima facie evidence of changed circumstances and where the audio record of the FRO hearing is no longer able to be transcribed, in whole or in part, without the fault of the moving party, the judge may conduct a plenary hearing to determine whether the party seeking modification or dissolution of the FRO is entitled to any relief.\nHere, the record does not show that the Family Part judge confirmed the inability to produce a transcript of the FRO proceedings. We do not know whether Court Smart was available at that time. Because the court considered the absence of the transcript as procedurally fatal, it never determined if defendant can show a prima facie case of \"good cause\" under N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d) without the transcript. If defendant cannot meet this burden under Carfagno factors, 288 N.J. Super. at 435, 672 A.2d 751, then reconstruction of the FRO record is not required.\nReversed and remanded to the Family Part for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.\nWe use initials and pseudonyms throughout this opinion because the case involves domestic violence litigation. R. 1:38-3(d)(9).\nIt is not clear from the copy of the complaint included in the appendix whether plaintiff also alleged the predicate offenses of stalking and assault.\nJudge Dangler retired on January 1, 2010.\nThe appendix does not include a dispositional order related to the cross-motion. We do not know if plaintiff was awarded attorney's fees.\n288 N.J. Super. 424, 672 A.2d 751 (Ch. Div. 1995). This court has adopted the factors identified by the Chancery Division in Carfagno. See T.M.S. v. W.C.P., 450 N.J. Super. 499, 502, 163 A.3d 929 (App. Div. 2017).",

                            "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLIHOTZ, P.J.A.D.\nMore than thirty years have passed since the Supreme Court issued Newburgh v. Arrigo, 88 N.J. 529, 443 A.2d 1031 (1982), which held “the privilege of parenthood carries with it the duty to assure a necessary education for children.” Id. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031. Necessary support for unemancipated children could include contribution toward the cost of a college education, even though the child has attained the age of majority. Id. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031. Since then, courts have struggled to define the scope of this parental obligation, as circumscribed by facts and circumstances unique to each family. In this case, we examine the court’s role in navigating the interplay between emancipation and a parent’s obligation to provide for a child’s support in the form of college tuition, when the child has left the parent’s home.\nPlaintiff Maura McGarvey appeals from several Family Part orders mandating she and defendant Michael Ricci, plaintiffs former husband, contribute to the college tuition expenses of intervenor, their now twenty-three-year-old daughter, Caitlyn Ric-ci. Plaintiff and defendant agreed Caitlyn was emancipated when she left her mother’s home to reside with her grandparents at age nineteen. Plaintiff and defendant filed a consent order terminating child support. Thereafter, Caitlyn moved to intervene in the matrimonial matter, seeking to vacate the emancipation order and require her parents to provide funds allowing her to attend college. In the October 11, 2013 order, the judge permitted Caitlyn to intervene and required plaintiff and defendant to pay the tuition cost for Gloucester County Community College (the community college), which was less than $2,000.\nPrior to completing her associate’s degree, Caitlyn transferred to Temple University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the university). She moved for plaintiff and defendant to pay annual tuition for the university, which, after awarded financial aid, was significantly more than the tuition at the community college. On October 31, 2014, a newly assigned judge considered Caitlyn’s motion. He concluded the issue was adjudicated and governed by the October 11, 2013 order. Accordingly, without benefit of a plenary hearing or review of financial documentation, the newly assigned judge âenforced” the October 11 order and required plaintiff and defendant satisfy the universityâs outstanding tuition, fees, and the cost of books.\nPlaintiff and defendant sought reconsideration and were assigned to return to the initial motion judge. Unfortunately, he limited his review to the provisions of the first order, not the October 31, 2014 order. Thus, the judge declined to examine whether and to what extent plaintiff and defendant could and should pay tuition to the university. He noted Caitlyn did not discuss attending the university in her October 2013 motion, revealing only plans to attend a state university once she earned her associate’s degree. In the December 6, 2014 order, the judge considered the factors identified in Newburgh, as to the request plaintiff and defendant satisfy community college tuition. There was no discussion regarding payment for the university. In that regard, the judge declined to reconsider the order to pay the university tuition set forth in the October 31, 2014 order.\nPlaintiff appeals from the October 11, 2013, October 31, 2014 and December 6, 2014 orders. Defendant also appeals from these orders. The matters were consolidated and we granted defendant’s motion to join in and rely on the brief submitted by plaintiff. Caitlyn filed a cross-appeal, challenging plaintiffs attack on the October 11, 2013 order and argued the denial of her request for attorney’s fees in the October 31, 2014 and December 6, 2014 orders was error.\nFollowing our review, we conclude the judge properly allowed Caitlyn to intervene in this action to advance her request for support. However, the record is void of the basis establishing Caitlyn was unemancipated at the time of the October 11, 2013 review. As more thoroughly discussed in our opinion, emancipation is a legal determination, which must be resolved prior to awarding support, including payment of college costs. Because this analysis is absent, we reverse and vacate the provisions of the challenged order addressed to emancipation and payment of support. We remand this matter for plenary review.\nI.\nThese facts are found in the record. Plaintiff and defendant were divorced when Caitlyn was four years old. Plaintiff was the parent of primary residence, defendant exercised regular parenting time and provided child support. The record reflects the parents shared decision-making responsibility regarding Caitlyn’s care.\nCaitlyn graduated from high school in June 2012. Various actions resulted in the conclusion Caitlyn was not ready to live away at college. With her parents’ urging and support, Caitlyn enrolled part-time in the community college. However, estrangement with her parents heightened, and Caitlyn left her mother’s home in February 2013, to reside with her paternal grandparents. Plaintiff and defendant agreed Caitlyn was emancipated. This decision was memorialized in a March 30, 2013 consent order terminating defendant’s obligation to pay child support.\nLegal action followed as Caitlyn moved to intervene in her parents’ dissolution action. She sought to vacate the March 30, 2013 order of emancipation, compel payment of her full-time community college education costs, provide financial assistance to acquire a new car, continue her health insurance coverage, and pay counsel fees and costs. Plaintiff and defendant objected to the relief Caitlyn requested. Specifically, both parents challenged Caitlyn’s request to intervene and asserted her conduct demonstrated her desire to be independent of parental control, which obviated any obligation for support.\nIn an accompanying certification, Caitlyn briefly mentions the family dynamics, stating, “substantial personal problems ... necessitated that I move out of my mother’s home .... I did not fit in well with her new family.” She also stated “I ... had substantial problems with my father’s new family!,] and thus he was not an option.”\nPlaintiff and defendant’s pleadings cast a different light on the parent-child relationship. Both parents expressed their love for Caitlyn and a willingness to address issues as a family; however, plaintiff and defendant separately opposed Caitlyn’s motion based on her conduct and choices. Their certifications detail the difficulties experienced with Caitlyn’s dangerous decisions and disobedience, which started while she was in high school. Caitlyn’s conduct included smoking marijuana while driving, engaging in underage drinking and sexual activity, participating in explicit sexual conversations on the internet, and attempting to hurt herself.\nPlaintiff explained she attempted to counsel her daughter, who nevertheless did not obey her requests, expressed dislike for imposed rules, and chose to leave her home. Plaintiff asserted Caitlyn “willingly, knowingly, [and] voluntarily left and went [out] on her own.”\nDefendant discussed his view of Caitlyn’s trouble with alcohol, drugs, and impulsive behavior, as well as her acts of opposition to plaintiffs imposition of discipline, including a curfew and the obligation to perform household chores. Defendant related his efforts to discuss these concerns with Caitlyn, which she repeatedly rebuffed. He stated Caitlyn refused to answer her parents’ texts or calls prior to filing her motion. Caitlyn had not spoken to either parent for six months; she ignored birthdays, a family member’s illness, and mother and father’s day. Finally, defendant pointedly objected to Caitlyn’s decision to reside with his parents, showing unequivocally he was estranged from them and blamed them for exacerbating parental relationship difficulties with Caitlyn.\nThe record also informed regarding Caitlyn’s college decisions. These facts are undisputed. When she was accepted to attend Montclair State University, plaintiff and defendant discussed contributing $5,000 each towards annual college costs, with the remainder satisfied by Caitlyn obtaining student loans. However, because of Caitlyn’s behavior, it was agreed she was not ready to live away from home, and should first attend community college. Defendant paid the summer and fall 2012 community college tuition, and Caitlyn attended part-time. In the winter of 2012, Caitlyn sought to attend the Disney College program in Florida. Plaintiff and defendant jointly agreed to support Caitlyn’s effort as a way of testing her readiness to live on her own. They fully paid for her participation and assisted her move to Florida. Unfortunately, within a month of arriving, Caitlyn was expelled for underage alcohol use as the host of a party in the dorms.\nThe parties disagreed on events occurring after Caitlyn returned from Florida. Plaintiff and defendant wanted Caitlyn to return to community college to compete her associate’s degree. With defendant’s support, plaintiff outlined a course of discipline, work, and community college courses demanded of her daughter. Plaintiff recounted how Caitlyn rejected these attempts to restore discipline and make-up missed college credits, stating she wanted instead to spend the summer with friends. Plaintiff asserted Caitlyn indulged in what she labeled frivolous spending, inappropriate use of Facebook, and multiple nights spent away from home. Plaintiff initiated counselling, but Caitlyn attended only one session and refused to continue. Caitlyn then decided to move to her grandparents’ home where she was not restricted.\nCaitlyn’s version expressed a different story. Caitlyn maintained she did not “run to her grandparents in defiance”; rather, plaintiff “kicked [her] out” when she returned from Disney. Alternatively, Caitlyn attributed the move to her grandparents as her parents’ âsuggestion.” Further, she characterized the behavior outlined by her parents as “things that teenagers typically do” and insisted the control exerted by her parents’ demands was “impossible.” Caitlyn asserted she was following the college path her parents dictated and accepted all conditions imposed, except the demand to work full-time and take three summer classes. She insisted the imposed unrealistic demands pushed her beyond the sphere of parental influence.\nCaitlyn initiated litigation only after plaintiff and defendant separately informed her they would not pay her community college costs because she was not residing with either of them. Caitlyn asserted she was a full-time community college student and, upon completion of her associate’s degree, planned to attend Rowan University. Pay stubs reflected Caitlyn grossed more than $400 per week waitressing.\nDuring oral argument, in response to plaintiffs suggested request for a plenary hearing to determine whether Caitlyn was unemancipated, the Family Part judge stated:\nWell, there may be a time in a future year that you need a plenary hearing, but based on the cost of the college for this year, I really think that would be overkill and I feel that the [e]ourt would have enough based upon the excellent briefs and the certifications that were submitted that I could make a decision today.\nDefendant’s counsel asked whether the order was intended to address just the current community college tuition request or possible future costs at a four-year school. The judge answered “I don’t think I can do that.”\nThe judge granted Caitlyn’s motion to intervene. Describing the matter as a “unique situation,” he deemed Caitlyn “un-emaneipat-ed [sic] solely for the purpose of a potential contribution from [her parents] as it relates to college costs.” In rendering his order, the judge rendered his order, stating he sought “to make the best economic decisionf,]” and limited the order’s provisions to payment of community college costs for the 2013-2014 school year. He ordered Caitlyn to seek and apply for loans and scholarships to reduce expenses. Caitlyn represented she had done so and was awarded $2,500. Noting financial information was not in the record, the judge stated plaintiff and defendant were to split remaining “costs related to ... tuition, fees and books.”\nAlso, the order stated:\n4. For subsequent school years, before determining ... [p]laintiff and [defendant's contribution to Gaitlyn’s tuition, fees and book costs, Caitlyn shall apply for all eligible loans and apply all eligible scholarships toward her tuition, fees, and book[ ] costs.\n5. On future matriculation (beginning the [flail of 2014), the [pjlaintiff and [defendant shall exchange tax returns and the three (3) most recent paystubs in regards to determining a child support percentage for each party. This child support percentage breakdown will determine the amount that the parties will pay towards Caitlyn’s college tuition and books[,] after Caitlyn has obtained all financial aid, grants, and scholarships.\n9. For future academic year's, all parties will attend economic mediation if they cannot agree to Caitlyn’s college tuition, fees, and books.\nThe order denied Caitlyn’s request for contribution toward the purchase of a new car and found plaintiff always maintained health insurance coverage for Caitlyn, making the request moot. Finally, “in a compensatory manner,” the judge awarded Caitlyn $1,000 in counsel fees and costs, payable $500 by each parent, which “shall come off the parties’ contribution towards Caitlyn’s college costs for tuition, fees and books for the 2013-[20]14 academic year.”\nCaitlyn was accepted to attend the university, commencing in the fall 2014. She notified plaintiff she was leaving community college and requested plaintiff complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Plaintiff agreed to do so but suggested Caitlyn first obtain her associate’s degree, noting she and defendant could not afford the university’s tuition cost.\nCaitlyn filed a motion to enforce litigant’s rights, seeking an order compelling plaintiff and defendant to attend economic mediation to fix their respective contributions toward the university’s tuition, fee and book costs and to reimburse past community college costs.\nCaitlyn stated the university’s financial aid evaluation “was calculated as if there would be no parenting [sic] contribution.” Total aid reduced the $27,000 annual tuition and fees by $19,180 per year, of which $14,000 represented student loans. Caitlyn believed it reasonable to incur only federally subsidized student loans, limiting her debt to $6,500. Consequently, she required plaintiff and defendant to allocate the remaining $17,000 per year. Thereafter, Caitlyn met with the university’s Senior Assistant Director of Student Financial Services. When Caitlyn explained she was “unemancipated” for college expense purposes, the university rescinded the financial aid package and required one parent complete the FAFSA.\nPlaintiff opposed Caitlyn’s motion; defendant did not file pleadings but appeared. The case was assigned to a different Family Part judge. The judge ordered the parties comply with the October 11, 2013 order’s prerequisite for economic mediation. His September 10, 2014 order also required they exchange financial information for the purposes of mediation, and plaintiff agreed to complete the FAFSA parental disclosure. The parties identified a mediator, and the session occurred in early October 2014. Mediation was not successful.\nReturning to the newly assigned motion judge, Caitlyn asserted her revised financial aid award was $9,250 per year. She applied for three of four additional loans suggested by plaintiff, but the lenders required eo-signors. Caitlyn argued the October 11, 2013 order directed plaintiff and defendant to allocate the university tuition and requested an order directing them to split the cost equally. Plaintiff and defendant opposed this request, asserting the order was limited to 2013-2014 community college tuition and left open other college costs. Further, the parents maintained the judge never considered payment of the university’s tuition, which they agreed they could not afford.\nThe newly assigned motion judge viewed plaintiff and defendant’s request not as a change in circumstances, but as a request for reconsideration of the October 11, 2013 order. He concluded reconsideration was not properly before him and must be handled by the initial motion judge. Enforcing his interpretation of that order’s provisions, he ordered plaintiff and defendant to satisfy the university tuition 40% and 60% respectively. The October 31, 2014 order also scheduled a plenary hearing to decide reimbursement of community college costs and ordered the parties to mediate any modification requests or future disputes. Finally, the judge denied Caitlyn’s application for attorney’s fees.\nPlaintiff and defendant moved for reconsideration of the October 31, 2014 order. Both argued the order was unfounded, as Caitlyn unilaterally left plaintiffs home; refused to compromise her demands or return home; transferred to an expensive out-of-state university; abandoned completion of community college or attending Rowan. Moreover, Caitlyn refused to communicate with her parents and continued to act independently, without regard to parental input. Finally, the court never reviewed whether and to what extent plaintiff and defendant should or could pay for any expenses beyond community college tuition.\nCaitlyn opposed the motions and filed a cross-motion for counsel fees. She additionally filed a separate motion seeking an order of contempt, sanctions, and enforcement of litigant’s rights. Disposition was returned to the original motion judge.\nConcluding the October 11, 2013 order was interlocutory, the judge limited his review to reconsideration of that order and declined to reconsider challenges to the October 31, 2014 order, stating “for today, I can’t address that.” The judge agreed to clarify Caitlyn’s obligation to apply for “all eligible loans ... and all eligible scholarships.” In his oral opinion, he explained Caitlyn must attempt to apply for and make a reasonable effort to secure “five or six” scholarships. He then reviewed each provision of the October 11, 2013 order and concluded the requirement to pay community college tuition was “de minimis.” The judge ordered plaintiff and defendant to equally satisfy the claimed balance of $906 and rejected Caitlyn’s request for attorney’s fees.\nThis court consolidated plaintiffs appeal and Caitlyn’s cross-appeal. Defendant joins in the brief submitted by plaintiff.\nII.\nA.\n“When reviewing a trial judge’s order, we defer to factual findings ’supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.’” Spangenberg v. Kolakowski, 442 N.J.Super. 529, 535, 125 A.3d 739 (App. Div. 2015) (quoting Gnall v. Gnall, 222 N.J. 414, 428, 119 A.3d 891 (2015)). However, reversal is warranted when the expressed factual findings are “so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.” Elrom v. Elrom, 439 N.J.Super. 424, 433, 110 A.3d 69 (App. Div. 2015) (quoting Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 65 N.J. 474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)).\nDiscretionary determinations, supported by the record, are examined to discern whether an abuse of reasoned discretion has occurred. Gac v. Gac, 186 N.J. 535, 547, 897 A.2d 1018 (2006).\nWhile an “abuse of discretion ... defies precise definition,” we will not reverse the decision absent a finding the judge’s decision “rested on an impermissible basis,” considered “irrelevant or inappropriate factors,” Flagg v. Essex Cnty. Prosecutor, 171 N.J. 561, 571, 796 A.2d 182 (2002) (citations ... omitted), “failed to consider controlling legal principles or made findings inconsistent with or unsupported by competent evidence.” Storey [v. Storey], 373 N.J.Super. [464,] 479, 862 A.2d 551 [ (App. Div. 2004) ].\n[Elrom, supra, 439 N.J.Super. at 434, 110 A.3d 69.]\nThis court does not accord the same deference to a trial judge’s legal determinations. Reese v. Weis, 430 N.J.Super. 552, 568, 66 A.3d 157 (App. Div. 2013). Rather, all legal issues are reviewed de novo. Ibid.\nB.\nAs a preliminary matter, we examine Caitlyn’s cross-appeal urging dismissal of plaintiffs attack on the October 11, 2013 order as time barred. R. 2:4-l(a) (requiring appeals be filed within forty-five days of the date final judgment or order is entered). “Where the appeal is untimely, the Appellate Division has no jurisdiction to decide the merits of the appeal.” In re Hill, 241 N.J.Super. 367, 372, 575 A.2d 42 (App. Div. 1990) (citing Alberti v. Civil Service Comm’n, 41 N.J. 147, 154, 195 A.2d 297 (1963)).\n“Generally, an order is considered final if it disposes of all issues as to all parties.” Silviera-Francisco v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Elizabeth, 224 N.J. 126, 136, 129 A.3d 1032 (2016). “By definition, an order that ’does not finally determine a cause of action but only decides some intervening matter pertaining to the cause[,] and which requires further steps ... to enable the court to adjudicate the cause on the merits[,]’ is interlocutory.” Moon v. Warren Haven Nursing Home, 182 N.J. 507, 512, 867 A.2d 1174 (2005) (alterations in original) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 815 (6th ed. 1990)).\nThe distinction between a final order, appealable of right, and an interlocutory order, which is not, is a “principle ... easily stated,” but “not always easily applied.” Wein v. Morris, 194 N.J. 364, 377, 944 A.2d 642 (2008). The distinction is critical because finality is a jurisdictional prerequisite for appeal, R. 2:2-3, and neither the parties nor the trial judge “may invest the Appellate Division with jurisdiction it does not otherwise have.” Pressler & Verniero, Current N.J. Court Rules, cmt. 2.2.1 on R. 2:2-3 (2017).\nWithout consideration of the legal sufficiency of its terms, we note the October 11, 2013 order answered the question of whether Caitlyn could intervene in her parents’ matrimonial action, imposed a limited provision regarding Caitlyn’s emancipation, and fixed parental obligations for the 2013-2014 community college tuition costs. The order’s terms also addressed “future matriculation” and “subsequent school years,” imposing executory obligations on all parties. Had the order resolved all issues regarding Caitlyn’s post-secondary school education, it would have been final. However, its terms, as well as the judge’s remarks on the provisions, show no final decision was made fixing the extent of the parental support beyond the 2013-2014 community college tuition costs.\nThe language used in paragraphs four and five of the order set procedures, laying the preliminary groundwork necessary to review allocation of future college costs. However, contrary to Caitlyn’s assertion, which was erroneously adopted in the October 30, 2014 order, the issue was never finally adjudicated. For example, paragraph four expressed a need for additional review, reciting Caitlyn’s obligations undertaken “before determining the [pjlaintiff and [defendant’s contribution” for subsequent school years. In addition, paragraph nine mentioned future academic years and imposed an economic mediation prerequisite, which further demonstrates said issues were open. Moreover, during the October 11, 2013 hearing, the judge remarked he had not reviewed financial information and ordered payment shared because the amount was “de minimis.” During the December 8, 2014 hearing, the judge clarified there were no prior discussions addressed to payment for the university or another college; the issues were limited to community college.\nWe conclude the October 11, 2013 order resolved intervention and dealt with the immediate community college tuition. The order settled only the interim issue and did not resolve all college contribution requests or finalize all rights and responsibilities of the parties by finally adjudicating the merits of all issues raised in the action. See Adams v. Adams, 53 N.J.Super. 424, 429, 147 A.2d 568 (App. Div.), certif. denied, 30 N.J. 151, 152 A.2d 170 (1959).\nOnce the proceeding concluded on December 8, 2014, with the denial of reconsideration of the October 11, 2013 order and rejection of reconsideration of the October 31, 2014 order, the obligation for college contributions became final for purposes of appeal. Accordingly, plaintiffs appeal properly sought review of all orders leading to the final determination. See Sutter v. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of N.J., 406 N.J.Super. 86, 106, 966 A.2d 508 (App. Div. 2009) (“ ‘An appeal from a final judgment raises the validity of all interlocutory orders’ previously entered in the trial court.” (quoting In re Carton, 48 N.J. 9, 15, 222 A.2d 92 (1966))).\nIII.\nFor the first time, plaintiff argues the challenged orders must be vacated because the Family Part has interfered with her constitutional right to raise her daughter.\n“[I]t is a well-settled principle that our appellate courts will decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when an opportunity for such a presentation is available unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.” [Zaman v. Felton, 219 N.J. 199, 226-27, 98 A.3d 503 (2014) (quoting State v. Robinson, 200 N.J. 1, 20, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009)) ].\nSee also Pressler & Verniero, supra, cmt. 3 on R. 2:6-2. Because we conclude clarification of the law is necessary, we have elected to address the merits of this argument.\nPlaintiffs constitutional challenge maintains the court may not interfere with a joint parental decision to set discipline and achievement requirements for Caitlyn. Caitlyn argues no constitutional violation arises. She urges the court properly enforced her right to support and her right to be educated, and suggests the controversy is only about money. These arguments speak to “the intersection between parents’ fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children, and the state’s interest in the protection of those children.” Fawzy v. Fawzy, 199 N.J. 456, 472-73, 973 A.2d 347 (2009).\nA.\nUnquestionably, “[t]he right to rear one’s children is so deeply embedded in our history and culture that it has been identified as a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” Id. at 473, 973 A.2d 347 (quoting Moriarty v. Bradt, 177 N.J. 84, 101, 827 A.2d 203 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1177, 124 S.Ct. 1408, 158 L.Ed.2d 78 (2004)). “The Federal and State Constitutions protect the inviolability of the family unit.” In re Adoption of a Child by W.P. & M.P., 308 N.J.Super. 376, 382, 706 A.2d 198 (App. Div. 1998) (citing Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212-13, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558-59 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 163 N.J. 158, 748 A.2d 515 (2000). Therefore, “[pjarents have a constitutionally protected, fundamental liberty interest in raising their biological children.” Id. at 382, 706 A.2d 198 (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394, 71 L.Ed.2d 599, 606 (1982)). See also Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232-33, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1541-42, 32 L.Ed.2d 15, 35 (1972) (explaining the “primary role” of parents in raising their children is “an enduring American tradition” and establishing the historic recognition of that right as fundamental); Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645, 652 (1944) (identifying privacy interest attached to child rearing, labeled the “private realm of family life which the state cannot enter”); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042, 1045 (1923) (characterizing parental right to raise children “as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men”).\nAs our Supreme Court has stated:\nDeference to parental autonomy means that the State does not second-guess parental decision making or interfere with the shared opinion of parents regarding how a child should be raised. Nor does it impose its own notion of a child’s best interests on a family. Bather, the State permits to stand unchallenged parental judgments that it might not have made or that could be characterized as unwise. That is because parental autonomy includes the “freedom to decide wrongly.” [Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 473-74, 973 A.2d 347 (quoting Janet Maleson Spencer & Joseph P. Zammit, Mediation-Arbitration: A Proposal for Private Resolution of Disputes Between Divorced or Separated Parents, 1976 Duke L.J. 911, 913 (1976)).]\nSee also Sacharow v. Sacharow, 177 N.J. 62, 79, 826 A.2d 710 (2003) (holding the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution “encompasses [the] ’fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their own children.’” (quoting Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 67, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2061, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, 60 (2000))).\nLegislation has been enacted to address and protect the parent-child relationship. Specifically, N.J.S.A. 9:17-39 states a “ ‘parent and child’ relationship means the legal relationship between a child and the child’s ... parents ... to which the law confers or imposes rights, privileges, duties, and obligations.” These rights, privileges, duties, and obligations extend to both parents “equally ... regardless of marital status.” N.J.S. A. 9:17-40.\nB.\nOne duty imposed by law requires parents provide financial support for their children. “The parental obligation to support children until they are emancipated is fundamental to a sound society.” Kiken v. Kiken, 149 N.J. 441, 446, 694 A.2d 557 (1997). See N.J.S.A. 9:17-53(e) (imposing an obligation to provide child support to those against whom parentage is established).\n“In an intact family, the law assumes the parents will provide for the children as well as they can.” Kiken, supra, 149 N.J. at 447, 694 A.2d 557. Payment of “[c]hild support after divorce is necessary to ensure that a child’s basic needs are provided by his parents, who might otherwise neglect their responsibilities to maintain the child.” Pascale v. Pascale, 140 N.J. 583, 590, 660 A.2d 485 (1995). See N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(a) (authorizing courts to establish or modify child support in pending matrimonial actions).\nThe Court has repeatedly emphasized “[c]hildren of divorce have the right to be supported at least according to the standard of living to which they had grown accustomed prior to the separation of their parents.” Pascale, supra, 140 N.J. at 592, 660 A.2d 485 (citations omitted). To that end, various principles have evolved.\nFirst, “[o]ne of the fundamental concepts in American society is that parents are expected to support their children until they are emancipated, regardless of whether the children live with one, both, or neither parent.” Burns v. Edwards, 367 N.J.Super. 29, 39, 842 A.2d 186 (App. Div. 2004) (citing Dunbar v. Dunbar, 190 U.S. 340, 351, 23 S.Ct. 757, 761, 47 L.Ed. 1084, 1092 (1903)); see also Cumberland Cnty. Bd. of Soc. Servs. v. W.J.P., 333 N.J.Super. 362, 365, 755 A.2d 1171 (App. Div. 2000) (noting that “[a]t common law, parents had an absolute duty to support them children”). The obligation to provide child support “is engrained into our common law, statutory, and rule-based jurisprudence.” Burns, supra, 367 N.J.Super. at 39, 842 A.2d 186.\nSecond, “it is settled that the best interests of the child [are] the greatest and overriding consideration in any family court matter.” Monmouth Cnty. Div. of Soc. Servs. v. G.D.M., 308 N.J.Super. 83, 88, 705 A.2d 408 (Ch. Div. 1997) (citing Wilke v. Culp, 196 N.J.Super. 487, 489, 483 A.2d 420 (App. Div. 1984)). Accordingly, enforcing the parental duty to support children is “an inherent part of the ’best interests of the child’ rubric which underlies our family courts.” Ibid. Accordingly, “a parent is obliged to contribute to the basic support needs of an unemancipated child to the extent of the parent’s financial ability[.]” Martinetti v. Hickman, 261 N.J.Super. [508, 513] 531, 546 [619 A.2d 599] (App. Div. 1992).... “[C]hildren are entitled to be supported at least according to the standard of living to which they had grown accustomed prior to the separation of their parents,” and the “talisman of concern is always the welfare of the child.” Guglielmo v. Guglielmo, 253 N.J.Super. 531, 546, 602 A.2d 741 (App. Div. 1992).\nThird, it is also firmly established that child support is for the benefit of the children; therefore, the right to receive support belongs to the children, not the custodial parent. Pascale, [supra], 140 N.J. at 591, 660 A.2d 485; Patetta v. Patetta, 358 N.J.Super. 90, 94, 817 A.2d 327 (App. Div. 2003); L.V. v. R.S., 347 N.J.Super. 33, 41, 788 A.2d 881 (App. Div. [2002] 2001); Blum v. Ader, 279 N.J.Super. 1, 4, 652 A.2d 176 (App. Div. 1994).\n[Colca v. Anson, 413 N.J.Super. 405, 414-15, 995 A.2d 855 (App. Div. 2010).]\nThe Legislature granted “equitable powers” to the Family Part, which allows the court to enter, revise or alter support orders “from time to time as circumstances may require.” N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23).\nAlthough parental disagreement is most often heightened in divorce matters, the event of divorce is not the basis of the court’s authority. Rather, the State’s parens patriae responsibility to protect the rights of children is the source of its authority. Importantly, a child’s right to support is not “defeated merely because both parents are united in their determination to declare the child emancipated.” Johnson v. Bradbury, 233 N.J.Super. 129, 136, 558 A.2d 61 (App. Div. 1989).\nHowever, the court’s authority to impose support obligations is circumscribed: it terminates with a child’s emancipation. Pascale, supra, 140 N.J. at 591, 660 A.2d 485; Martinetti, supra, 261 N.J.Super. at 512, 619 A.2d 599. “Where there is no longer a duty of support by virtue of a judicial declaration of emancipation, no child support can become due.” Mahoney v. Pennell, 285 N.J.Super. 638, 643, 667 A.2d 1119 (App. Div. 1995).\nA determination of emancipation is a legal issue, imposed when the fundamental dependent relationship between parent and child ends. See Dolce v. Dolce, 383 N.J.Super. 11, 17, 890 A.2d 361 (App. Div. 2006) (stating emancipation is “the conclusion of the fundamental dependent relationship between parent and child”). It is not automatic and “need not occur at any particular age .... ” Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031. When circumstances surrounding the parent-child relationship support a finding the child is emancipated, “the parent relinquishes the right to custody and is relieved of the burden of support, and the child is no longer entitled to support.” Filippone v. Lee, 304 N.J.Super. 301, 308, 700 A.2d 384 (App. Div. 1997).\nDeciding whether a child is emancipated requires a fact-sensitive analysis. Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031. “[T]he essential inquiry is whether the child has moved ‘beyond the sphere of influence and responsibility exercised by a parent and obtains an independent status of his or her own.’ ” Filippone, supra, 304 N.J.Super. at 308, 700 A.2d 384 (quoting Bishop v. Bishop, 287 N.J.Super. 593, 598, 671 A.2d 644 (Ch. Div. 1995)). A court’s emancipation “determination involves a critical evaluation of the prevailing circumstances including the child’s need, interests, and independent resources, the family’s reasonable expectations, and the parties’ financial ability, among other things.” Dolce, supra, 383 N.J.Super. at 18, 890 A.2d 361 (citing Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 545, 443 A.2d 1031).\nA parent establishes “prima facie, but not conclusive, proof of emancipation” when a child reaches the age of majority, now eighteen. Id. at 17, 890 A.2d 361. See also N.J.S.A. 9:17B-3. Once the presumption arises, the burden of proof to rebut the statutory presumption of emancipation shifts to the party or child seeking to continue the support obligation. Filippone, supra, 304 N.J.Super. at 308, 700 A.2d 384.\n“In certain situations, parents still have an economic duty to support children after their eighteenth birthday .... ” Llewelyn v. Shewchuk, 440 N.J.Super. 207, 215, 111 A.3d 1132 (App. Div. 2015) (quoting N.J. Div. of Youth & Family Services v. W.F., 434 N.J.Super. 288, 296, 83 A.3d 892 (App. Div.) (quoting Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031), certif. denied, 218 N.J. 275, 94 A.3d 912 (2014)). “[W]hile parents are not generally required to support a child over eighteen, his or her enrollment in a full-time educational program has been held to require continued support.” Patetta v. Patetta, 358 N.J.Super. 90, 94, 817 A.2d 327 (App. Div. 2003). See also Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031; Khalaf v. Khalaf, 58 N.J. 63, 71-72, 275 A.2d 132 (1971). “[I]n appropriate circumstances, the privilege of parenthood carries with it the duty to assure a necessary education for children.” Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 543, 443 A.2d 1031. In this regard, college costs are recognized as a form of support for unemancipated children. See Gac, supra, 186 N.J. at 542, 897 A.2d 1018 (“The Legislature and our courts have long recognized a child's need for higher education and that this need is a proper consideration in determining a parent’s child support obligation.”); Kiken, supra, 149 N.J. at 453, 694 A.2d 557 (“N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(a) authorizes courts to enter reasonable and equitable support orders, including orders for the education of children.”).\nPrior to addressing whether parental support is required for a child who reaches majority, the pivotal question is whether the child remains unemancipated. If so, the next consideration is whether the child has an aptitude for college. “Newburgh does not require ... support and concomitant deferred emancipation for a child unable to perform adequately in his [or her] academic program.” Filippone, supra, 304 N.J.Super. at 311-12, 700 A.2d 384. If each of these questions is affirmatively answered, then parental ability to afford the significant cost of college must be examined; it is not presumed.\nSome parents cannot pay, some can pay in part, and still others can pay the entire cost of higher education for their children. In general, financially capable parents should contribute to the higher education of children who are qualified students. In appropriate circumstances, parental responsibility includes the duty to assure children of a college and even of a postgraduate education such as law school.\n[Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 544, 443 A.2d 1031.]\nTo aid this determination, the Court in Newburgh provides specific factors guiding the analysis of whether and to what extent an obligation to pay for higher education is imposed. Id. at 545, 443 A.2d 1031. The Newburgh factors\nmust be carefully applied by the trial court in light of a wide range of relevant facts and circumstances. The undertaking cannot be accomplished except after a presentation of all the evidence through direct and cross-examination and until the trial court has had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. The issue ... implicates “highly significant policy considerations,” and for this reason should not be decided on less than a full record.\n[Bradbury, supra, 233 N.J.Super. at 136-37, 558 A.2d 61 (quoting Jackson v. Muhlenberg Hosp., 53 N.J. 138, 142, 249 A.2d 65 (1969)).]\n“It remains the ultimate responsibility of the judiciary to address the fact[-]sensitive issue of emancipation when present ed.” Pennell, supra, 285 N.J.Super. at 643, 667 A.2d 1119. As we have recently advised: “The critical evaluation required for emancipation determinations typically necessitates a plenary hearing, especially ’when the submissions show there is a genuine and substantial factual dispute[,]’ which the trial court must resolve.” Shewchuk, supra, 440 N.J.Super. at 217, 111 A.3d 1132 (quoting Hand v. Hand, 391 N.J.Super. 102, 105, 917 A.2d 269 (App. Div. 2007)). So too, the examination of parental obligations to provide college contributions for unemancipated children requires a hearing. Bradbury, supra, 233 N.J.Super. at 136-37, 558 A.2d 61.\nC.\nApplying these principles to the facts at hand, we reject plaintiffs challenge attacking the order allowing Caitlyn to intervene. We conclude the judge correctly determined Caitlyn had standing to do so. Llewelyn, supra, 440 N.J.Super. at 214, 111 A.3d 1132; Bradbury, supra, 233 N.J.Super. at 136, 558 A.2d 61. See also Pressler & Verniero, supra, cmt. 1 on R. 4:33-1 (requiring a party moving to intervene must “show an interest in the subject matter of the litigation, an inability to protect that interest without intervention, lack of adequate representation of that interest, and timeliness of the application”). Caitlyn has an interest in advancing the position she is unemaneipated and in need of her parents’ support.\nHowever, plaintiffs challenge to the conclusion Caitlyn was unemancipated must be considered. Here, the October 11, 2013 order and hearing record are void of factual findings supporting such a legal conclusion. Following our review, we are unable to determine how or why the judge concluded to vacate the prior order of emancipation.\nRule l:7-4(a) requires a judge, “by an opinion or memorandum decision, either written or oral, find the facts and state [all] conclusions of law ... on every motion decided by a written order that is appealable as of right .... ” Fodero v. Fodero, 355 N.J.Super. 168, 170, 809 A.2d 840 (App. Div. 2002). We emphasize a judge’s failure to perform the fact-finding duty “constitutes a disservice to the litigants, the attorneys and the appellate court.” Curtis v. Finneran, 83 N.J. 563, 569-70, 417 A.2d 15 (1980) (quoting Kenwood Assocs. v. Bd. of Adjustment Englewood, 141 N.J.Super. 1, 4, 357 A.2d 55 (App. Div. 1976)).\nIn opposing Caitlyn’s motion, plaintiff and defendant asserted Caitlyn, by her own actions and decisions, was emancipated. The certifications accompanying the motion papers include quite divergent statements on this single issue. Not only is there a material dispute about why Caitlyn left plaintiffs home and did not seek residence with defendant, but also at issue is whether Caitlyn diligently pursued her secondary school education, whether she was a full-time student, and whether Caitlyn affirmatively rejected efforts undertaken to exercise reasonable parental influence to require she act responsibly.\nPlaintiff and defendant emphatically rejected the narrative they “secretly” sought emancipation to avoid financial responsibility. Rather, plaintiff and defendant maintain Caitlyn frivolously squandered their emotional and financial efforts because she desired to do what she wanted, without parental oversight. They argue Caitlyn rejected their authority to strike out on her own, sealing her emancipated status.\nOn the other hand, Caitlyn asserts she “made some mistakes” but was dutiful and reasonably compliant. However, her parents continued to impose “impossible” requisites, in a joint effort to thwart her efforts by foreclosing financial assistance.\nIt appears the initial motion judge recognized plaintiff and defendant’s prior provision of educational support to allow Cait-lyn’s attendance at community and Disney college. He may have assumed Caitlyn remained dependent and, therefore, was uneman-cipated. The judge’s comments also suggest a desire to save the parties time and money by avoiding a plenary hearing on the subject, perhaps believing payment of the relatively small sum in controversy might mitigate fractures caused in the family and reunite the parties.\nDespite these very well intentioned purposes, the threshold legal question of emancipation, which must precede any Newburgh analysis, was not examined. Plaintiff and defendant advanced facts showing Caitlyn, who was well over the age of eighteen, rejected parental guidance and advice, because they were accompanied by strings related to discipline and performance. Caitlyn does not deny she committed the complained of conduct or that her actions triggered parental demands for reform. Rather, she dismisses her behavior as “things that teenagers typically do,” tempered by an admission she made some mistakes.\nWhether Caitlyn’s actions were irresponsible, as plaintiff and defendant suggest, or youthful, as Caitlyn insists, begs the question. What is required is an examination of events that triggered Caitlyn’s departure from her mother’s home and the resultant March 30, 2013 order of emancipation. The fact that Caitlyn is not living with either parent is significant. How that event occurred bears heavily on whether Caitlyn exercised “an independent status of ... her own” and became emancipated. Filippone, supra, 304 N.J.Super. at 308, 700 A.2d 384.\nCaitlyn’s subsequent decisions and interactions with her parents also bears on this issue. The dependent parent-child relationship indicative of unemancipation is not merely shown by a child’s claimed need for financial support. Our jurisprudence unmistakably mandates there must be examination of the parent-child relationship itself. Shewchuk, supra, 440 N.J.Super. at 216, 111 A.3d 1132. In fact, a better description is the relationship is one of interdependence: the child’s right to support and the parents’ obligation to provide payment are inextricably linked to the child’s acceptance and the parents’ measured exercise of guidance and influence. Conversely, a finding of emancipation is a recognition of a child’s independence from a parental influence.\nDespite the detail of events and the expressed strength of conviction, the positions of the parties’ in their pleadings are at odds, and the legal conclusion Caitlyn is unemancipated cannot be upheld. Such “material factual disputes presented by the parties’ pleadings bear directly on the legal conclusions required to be made and these disputes can only be resolved through a plenary hearing.” Spangenberg, supra, 442 N.J.Super. at 540-41, 125 A.3d 739. See Hand, supra, 391 N.J.Super. at 105, 917 A.2d 269 (stating a plenary hearing is necessary when the parties’ submissions show a genuine and substantial factual dispute). The parties are entitled to present their proofs and the judge must sift through the evidence and state the supported factual findings. Importantly, “[t]he credibility of the parties’ contentions may wither, or may be fortified, by exposure to cross-examination and through clarifying questions posed by the eourt[ ]” in a plenary hearing. Barblock v. Barblock, 383 N.J.Super. 114, 122, 890 A.2d 1005 (App. Div.), cert. denied, 187 N.J. 81, 899 A.2d 304 (2006). See also Segal v. Lynch, 211 N.J. 230, 264-65, 48 A.3d 328 (2012) (holding a “genuine, material and legitimate factual dispute” requires resolution following a plenary hearing).\nIf her parents’ prove their claims, Caitlyn’s choices have consequences: a child is free to control his or her life; however, this course relieves her parents of the obligation to finance such self-determined decisions. See Black v. Black, 436 N.J.Super. 130, 146, 92 A.3d 688 (Ch. Div. 2013) (“If an adult ‘child’ refuses to have a relationship with a parent without a clear showing of exceptional circumstances, and ... refuses to participate in trying to heal the relationship, ... the child’s message rings loud and clear ... the parent/child relationship no longer has any value.”). If the evidence sustains Caitlyn’s version of events that her parents “threw” her out despite her rigorous compliance with their “impossible” demands, the court must protect the child’s right to financial support.\nWe also correct what appears to be a misinterpretation of the law. We focus on the declaration Caitlyn was “un-emancipated [sic] solely for the purpose of a potential contribution from [her parents] as it relates to college costs.”\nA child’s decision to seriously pursue a college education alone does not create the required dependency allowing him or her to be unemancipated. In Filippone, this court concluded the parties’ son, who left home at age fourteen, was not emancipated until he reached the age of majority and, thereafter, unsuccessfully completed college classes. Filippone, supra, 304 N.J.Super. at 312, 700 A.2d 384. In Llewelyn, we affirmed the Family Part’s finding the plaintiff-child failed to rebut the presumption of emancipation, when she decided to leave her mother’s home, despite her later pursuit of education as a full-time college student. Llewelyn, supra, 440 N.J.Super. at 218-19, 111 A.3d 1132.\nThus, facts matter, and the judge must fully analyze all circumstances that separated Caitlyn from her parents and their homes. It is insufficient to merely review Caitlyn’s decisions and her parents’ financial status at the time Caitlyn filed her motion. An independent child choosing her own path is not entitled to support because support is due only to a child who is not emancipated. Pennell, supra, 285 N.J.Super. at 643, 667 A.2d 1119.\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the order allowing Caitlyn to intervene. We reverse, as factually unsupported, the provisions in the October 11, 2013 order concluding Caitlyn is unemancipated and plaintiff and defendant must provide college contributions. On these issues, the October 11, 2013 order is vacated, and the matter remanded for further proceedings, including a plenary hearing. See Tretola v. Tretola, 389 N.J.Super. 15, 20-21, 910 A.2d 630 (App. Div. 2006) (reversing a court’s denial of the plaintiff-father’s request to emancipate his son because the court “failed to recognize there were material facts in dispute and evidence beyond the motion papers necessary for resolution of the matter” following an evidentiary hearing, when the child is “both employed and attending college full time.”).\nOn October 31, 2014, the provisions of the October 11, 2013 order were mistakenly viewed as requiring each parent contribute to any and all college costs. However, the record shows no analysis of Newburgh’s, factors was undertaken, and the prior order was based on less than a complete record. Moreover, as we point out, no findings supported the issue of emancipation. Consequently, the October 31, 2014 order, which purported to enforce the October 11, 2013 order, is also vacated. We add these additional comments to aid review on remand.\nOnce the issue of emancipation is decided, an obligation to pay college costs for an academically motivated unemancipated child requires a two-fold analysis. First, it demands a determination of whether equitable or other considerations militate against parents paying college costs. See Gac, supra, 186 N.J. at 547, 897 A.2d 1018 (“[A] parent or child seeking contribution should initiate the application to the court before the expenses are incurred. The failure to do so will weigh heavily against the grant of a future application.”); Moss v. Nedas, 289 N.J.Super. 352, 356, 674 A.2d 174 (App. Div. 1996) (noting parent cannot be viewed as a “wallet” and deprived of involvement of college decision making process); Black, supra, 436 N.J.Super. at 146, 92 A.3d 688 (“[A] student’s rejection of the opportunity to attempt reunification with a parent may be factually so compelling as to equitably overshadow and eclipse the other Newburgh factors, and tilt the scales of justice in favor of suspending or completely terminating the parent’s obligation to financially contribute towards the child’s college education.”).\nSecond, the court must scrutinize whether the parents are financially capable of contributing. Weitzman v. Weitzman, 228 N.J.Super. 346, 357, 549 A.2d 888 (App. Div. 1988). This requires broader consideration than parental gross incomes. Other financial obligations, expenses and debts must be weighed. Here, for example, plaintiff and defendant each are responsible to support other minor children, which reduces income available to pay college costs. Indeed, the college student’s contribution also should be factored. This includes assets, income, scholarships, loans and other financial aid.\nThe October 31, 2014 order includes no analysis supporting the allocation of the university tuition, fees and books, 40% to plaintiff and 60% to defendant. Therefore, even if Caitlyn is found to be unemaneipated, the order cannot stand. See Rule l:7-4(a).\nWe reject Caitlyn’s claim plaintiffs motion for reconsideration was untimely and also reverse the December 8, 2014 order. Plaintiff challenged the October 31, 2014 order’s interpretation of provisions ordered on October 11, 2013. Unfortunately, the reviewing judge erred when he limited his authority to consider only the terms of the October 11, 2013 order.\nIV.\nWe turn to Caitlyn’s cross-appeal, which seeks reversal of the provisions denying her application for attorney’s fees on October 31, 2014 and December 8, 2014. New Jersey does not subscribe to a system that “loser pays.” Statutory provisions, N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23, court rules, R. 5:3-5(c), R. 4:42-9(a), and interpretative case law, see, e.g., Mani v. Mani, 183 N.J. 70, 94-95, 869 A.2d 904 (2005), clearly outline necessary considerations when imposing a counsel fee award. The reviewing judges made findings, albeit limited ones, regarding the plaintiff and defendant’s good faith in advancing the arguments presented, which encompasses one consideration. Reese, supra, 430 N.J.Super. at 586, 66 A.3d 157. Nevertheless, since we have vacated the orders, attorney fee requests may abide the ordered remand proceedings.\nV.\nIn summary, the starting point of the remand proceedings determines whether Caitlyn was emancipated when she left her parents’ homes. Only when Caitlyn proves she was unemancipated must a Newburgh analysis commence. See Newburgh, supra, 88 N.J. at 542, 443 A.2d 1031 (“Resolution of [the right to continued educational support] centers on a parent’s duty to support a child until the child is emancipated. Consequently, [the child], if un-emancipated, may be entitled” to continued support). This includes all facts and circumstances surrounding the requested college contributions, including the scope and cause of ongoing estrangement and non-communication. Cf. Philipp v. Stahl, 344 N.J.Super. 262, 272-73, 781 A.2d 1065 (App. Div. 2001) (holding the absence of a relationship between parent and child was “one of the many factors that go into” the determination of post-secondary support), rev’d on other grounds, 172 N.J. 293, 798 A.2d 83 (2002). See also Gac, supra, 186 N.J. at 546, 897 A.2d 1018 (noting a parent or child seeking contribution for college expenses must inform and communicate with the parties concerning “the many issues inherent in selecting a college”); Nedas, supra, 289 N.J.Super. at 356, 674 A.2d 174. Upon an affirmative showing college contribution is warranted, the inquiry turns to the amount of the financial obligation itself. This encompasses parental ability to pay, Weitzman, supra, 228 N.J.Super. at 357, 549 A.2d 888 (stating among the Newburgh factors, parents’ ability to pay is clearly the most significant), the child’s contributions, and reasonableness of choice to enroll in a chosen school, despite a comparable available education at other more economical universities, see Finger v. Zenn, 335 N.J.Super. 438, 444-45, 762 A.2d 702 (App. Div. 2000), certif. denied, 167 N.J. 633, 772 A.2d 935 (2001).\nOur final comments are observational. A plenary hearing on emancipation, mandated by law, has one winner and the chasm between parents and child surely will widen whatever the outcome. The initial motion judge was very sensitive to this possibility and urged the parties to seek an alternate course to reach resolution. We applaud that effort imbued with common sense. We also recognize demands placed on our Family Part judges do not allow the luxury of uninterrupted consideration of one matter at a time. Therefore, in addition to being emotionally draining and time consuming, litigation is expensive. In light of these realities, before undertaking the course outlined by law, we encourage the parties give serious consideration to whether their positions, and hopefully their relationship, could be reconciled by a different course of dispute resolution, which unlike litigation, might more closely address the dynamic and complex interactions between parents and child.\nAffirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part for additional proceedings as discussed in this opinion.\nPlaintiff's brief states mediation was held on October 2, while Caitlyn and plaintiff's pleadings identify mediation was held on October 9.\nWe recognize remarks by the initial judge in entering the order suggest the October 11, 2013 order's requirements for modest payment amount appeared directed to deescalate this family’s growing alienation and sought to prompt healing of their emotional turmoil.\nWe note, the December 6, 2014 order clarified Caitlyn's responsibility to apply for scholarships, and she acquired financial aid.",

                            "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLIHOTZ, J.A.D.\nThis matter considers what role, if any, the Family Part should play after parties in a matrimonial action agree to submit their disputes to binding arbitration and whether the arbitrator, having first mediated disputes, may thereafter resume the role of arbitrator. Following the commencement of divorce proceedings, plaintiff Barbara Minkowitz and defendant Ron Israeli agreed to forgo judicial determination of all financial issues in favor of binding arbitration and agreed all custody and parenting time issues would be reviewed in non-binding arbitration. The parties consented to engage a single arbitrator and a jointly chosen forensic accounting expert. After the arbitrator met with them, but prior to the commencement of arbitration proceedings, the parties opted to engage in settlement discussions and mediation to narrow the issues for final determination. As matters were resolved, written documents incorporating the parties’ understanding were prepared. After more than one year had elapsed and a majority of their disagreements were settled without commencement of an arbitration hearing, plaintiff retained new counsel, who sought the underlying documentation supporting the financial agreements. The request was declined and, thereafter, plaintiff moved before the arbitrator for release of the documents. He barred release and counsel re-filed the requests before the Family Part. The Family Part judge generally denied the motions and ultimately confirmed the “arbitration awards” as final judgments.\nOn appeal, plaintiff challenges five separate orders confirming arbitration awards. She maintains each must be set aside under N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-23 or, alternatively, requests the final judgment of divorce be vacated, pursuant to Rule 4:50-1. Plaintiff argues procedural violations, the arbitrator’s bias and substantive errors caused an unconscionable result, which cannot stand.\nFollowing our review, we affirm the orders confirming the settlement agreements reached by the parties. However, we conclude once the arbitrator functioned as a mediator, he may not then conduct arbitration hearings. Consequently, we vacate those orders confirming substantive arbitration awards issued subsequent to the parties’ execution of the mediated agreements. The matter is remanded to the Family Part for the parties to select a new arbitrator, who will conduct a binding arbitration hearing on any remaining financial disagreements. We also conclude under the terms of the parties’ arbitration agreement, plaintiff has an entitlement to the requested documentation, the provision of which shall be addressed by the new arbitrator, once appointed.\nI.\nPlaintiff filed her complaint for divorce on March 18, 2008, after fourteen years of marriage. The parties have two children who are now teenagers.\nThe parties executed an agreement engaging a designated arbitrator, to “arbitrate the matter” and “render a written opinion incorporating his findings and conclusions of law in support of the award[.]” The arbitration agreement provided, in pertinent part:\n1. The issues to be arbitrated shall be identified by the parties and placed on the record prior to the commencement of any hearing. The record will further reflect those issues that are being submitted to nonbinding, as distinguished from binding, arbitration.\n7. The Arbitrator shall have the power to issue subpoenas and to order depositions or other discovery in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-17.\n8. The [Arbitrator shall have the power to order equitable remedies, if appropriate, unless the parties agree otherwise, in writing.\n10. Unless waived by the parties, in writing, the Arbitrator shall render a written opinion incorporating his findings and conclusions of law in support of the award.\n13. The Agreement shall be subject to the Arbitration Aetr,] ... N.J.S.A. 2A23B-1 to —32[ ].\nAttached to the three-page arbitration agreement was a two-page document, which the parties also signed, entitled “STATEMENT OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ARBITRATING PERSONS.” Among the rights listed was “[airbitrating [plersons have the right to be provided copies of all documents presented to the [arbitrator by their spouse.”\nThe parties and their respective counsel also executed a consent order, filed with the Family Part, memorializing the agreement to arbitrate. The order reiterated those issues submitted to binding and non-binding arbitration; recited the designated arbitrator and payment of his retainer; and allocated the party’s respective obligations for future payment of arbitration fees and costs. Finally, the order directed the arbitrator to schedule a “preliminary [c]ase Management [e]onferenee with the parties and the [cjourtappointed accountant” and, concurrently, set “a case management date ... with the court for ... September 3, 2008.” The parties mutually stipulated and the court subsequently appointed Seymour Rubin of Rubin-Goertz & Company as their “joint forensic accounting” expert.\nAlthough the arbitrator had been appointed and met with the parties, they filed a joint application before the Family Part seeking a protective order, which prescribed “[ejonfidential Material” could be disclosed only to the parties, their attorneys, their attorneys’ respective staff, Rubin, the arbitrator, and the court. The protective order filed on January 27, 2009, defined “confidential material” as “information pertaining to ... parties and/or all entities” listed on an attached schedule, which included the parties’ business interests.\nThe arbitrator met with the parties and their attorneys in August 2008. Thereafter, counsel and the parties’ respective accountants, but not the parties themselves, conferenced to review Rubin’s financial evaluations. The parties chose to defer commencement of arbitration, pending efforts to settle some disputes. The parties, their counsel, Rubin, and at times, the arbitrator discussed their respective positions and submitted documentation. Rubin would offer a recommendation regarding resolution, and, if the parties accepted, a written agreement would be prepared. Following this process, the parties executed four agreements in 2009, which we collectively refer to as the 2009 agreements.\nThe first of the 2009 agreements, reached in February 2009, was presented to the Family Part via a consent order. The April 1, 2009 order simply stated: “The [ajrbitration [cjonsent [ojrder as to [ejquitable [djistribution of [mjedical [pjractices, attached hereto, is hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof[,J and shall have the full force and effect of an [ojrder of this [cjourt.” The “arbitration consent order” included the Superior Court caption, but was signed by the arbitrator, the parties and counsel, and provided:\nBach party on the recommendation of the joint forensic accounting expert ... Rubin ... and after discussions with their respective counsel agree that he and she shall waive any right, title and/or interest ... in the medical practice of the other party and each party shall retain their own respective medical praetdce(s) free and clear of any claim by the other.\nThe “arbitration consent order” also stated it “shall be incorporated into any [pjroperty [sjettlement [ajgreement and/or [¡Judgment of [djivorce entered into by the parties and the [cjourt.”\nInformal discussions continued with an eye toward resolving the parties’ respective claims for equitable distribution. On July 8, 2009, the parties executed their second agreement, a âMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING,” which provided:\nThis memorandum ... shall describe the outline of an Agreement that was reached between the parties ... after mediation with the assistance of ... “the [a]rbitrator” and Seymour Rubin, C.P.A.\nIt is understood that this Memorandum shall be binding with respect to the issues recited herein, although a formal Agreement will be prepared and subsequently executed.\nThis Memorandum is the result of many months of negotiations and many conferences with [the arbitrator] and Mr. Rubin. The parties are entering into this Memorandum freely and voluntarily after conferring with their attorneys and anyone else with whom they wish to confer. The parties agree that this Memorandum represents a fair compromise of the issues. They acknowledge that by entering into this Memorandum, they are waiving their rights to participate in Arbitration hearings and waive the right to have the issues set forth in this Memorandum decided by the Arbitrator.\nIn this agreement, the parties restated the confidentiality of the financial disclosures; mutually waived alimony, and fixed child support; divided household furnishings, disposed and distributed various realty, retirement assets, stock and bank accounts, divided other joint assets; agreed to “pay their own counsel fees[,J” “equally share” the fees of the arbitrator and Rubin; and waived present and future claims for “prior, present or future claims” against one another. In the event of any further disputes, the memorandum required “written presentations from each attorney” to be submitted to the arbitrator.\nDefendantâs counsel prepared a draft of a proposed property settlement agreement (PSA), purportedly memorializing the parties’ agreements reached on the identified issues. However, a disagreement regarding the value and disposition of the former marital home occurred, which was resolved consensually in a three-page handwritten “Amendment to Memorandum of Understanding” dated September 22, 2009, the parties’ third agreement. Next, a conference call, conducted by the arbitrator, settled 2008 tax issues, the terms of which were included in a memorandum of agreement dated October 15, 2009, which represents the fourth agreement.\nPlaintiff hired co-counsel to assist in drafting and finalizing the PSA. She corresponded with Rubin explaining her role and requesting a meeting “to review his forensic findings,” which served as the underpinnings of the parties’ agreements. Defendant objected, claiming all matters were settled, except for relatively minor financial concerns. In a series of letters, Rubin consulted the arbitrator, who advised against his meeting with co-counsel, absent a formal application. On behalf of plaintiff, co-counsel wrote to the arbitrator requesting Rubin be instructed to meet with her and plaintiff “to review the financial information and compilation of forensic information and analyses” prepared by him. The arbitrator denied plaintiff’s request to meet with Rubin in a letter dated November 23,2009, advising:\nPrior to the execution of the [m]emorandum of [understanding and the [a]mendment thereto, Mr. Eubin spent many hours discussing the financial and property issues with [plaintiffs original counsel, plaintiff] and her accountant (as he did with [defendant’s counsel, defendant] and his accountant)____[Plaintiffs original counsel] and your client’s accountant should be able to explain the reasons why the issues recited in both agreements were resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.\nMr. Eubin has already reviewed his forensic findings in great detail with [plaintiffs original counsel, plaintiff] and her accountant.\nAt this point, plaintiffs original counsel filed an application before the Family Part to substitute co-counsel as plaintiffs representative and requested he be relieved. Plaintiff then moved before the Family Part for an order requiring Rubin’s production of all evaluations of the parties’ respective incomes and/or cash flow prepared “in accordance with the [protective [c]onsent [o]rder entered in this matter.” On the return date, substituted counsel, now acting as plaintiffs attorney, challenged the lack of disclosure provided to her and argued the 2009 agreements were âinvalid.” The Family Part judge dismissed the motion stating, “[t]he parties ha[d] previously agreed that all financial aspects [we]re subject to binding arbitration. Any application seeking to modify this agreement must be made to the agreed upon arbitrator.” Later that afternoon, the parties reached a settlement on custody and parenting time, which was placed on the record.\nA consent dual judgment of divorce (JOD) was filed on March 8, 2010. The JOD specifically referenced and incorporated the parties’ custody and parenting time agreement, set forth a timeline for resolving remaining financial issues, and noted any subsequent confirmed arbitration awards would be incorporated into the JOD, nunc pro tunc. Finally, plaintiffs demand for the production of financial documents was referred to the arbitrator.\nAs provided in the JOD, plaintiff filed a motion before the arbitrator, using the Family Part caption, seeking his recusal, or alternatively, requiring production of Rubin’s financial documents, including reports regarding the parties’ respective incomes and/or cash flow. Plaintiffs supporting certification inferred bias, stating the arbitrator had acted as both mediator and arbitrator throughout the proceeding. She also explained her need to obtain copies of Rubin’s underlying documentation and attached a certification from her accountant, asserting the meeting with Rubin did not allow sufficient time to review the calculations or the underlying documentation.\nDefendant opposed plaintiffs requests and filed a cross-motion for payment of attorney’s fees. He included certifications from his accountant, who refuted the characterization of the Rubin meetings. Rubin also filed a certification challenging facts asserted by plaintiff. He avowed the conference resulting in the agreement to distribute the medical practices lasted more than two-and-one-half hours, during which he presented “a detailed analysis of the federal income tax returns for the calendar years 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 as filed jointly by [the parties].”\nAn April 27, 2010 arbitration hearing addressed the issues raised in the cross-motions. In his decision, later incorporated in a May 25, 2010 award, the arbitrator denied plaintiffs application for recusal, explaining: “My role ... was to make recommendations, when requested, on the various financial issues____At no time did I assume the role of mediator. I did not participate in the discussions of the financial information.” The arbitrator rejected plaintiffs contention she was denied sufficient information to knowledgeably make the decisions set forth in the 2009 agreements, quoting extensively from correspondence sent by her former counsel. The arbitrator also drew an adverse inference because plaintiff had not included a certification from former counsel, who the arbitrator found interacted directly with Rubin and participated in the conferences.\nPlaintiff returned to the Family Part seeking to set aside the May 25, 2010 arbitration order, requesting the same relief denied by the arbitrator. Defendant opposed plaintiffs motion in all respects and moved to disqualify counsel, confirm the May 25, 2010 arbitration order, and finalize outstanding issues.\nOn July 16, 2010, the trial court entered an order summarily denying plaintiffs motion in its entirety, denying defendant’s cross-motion to disqualify counsel and confirming the May 25, 2010 arbitration decision. Plaintiff moved for reconsideration, which was summarily denied.\nThe parties returned to arbitration. In a November 10, 2010 proceeding conducted by the arbitrator, the parties agreed to a proposed allocation of debits and credits as computed by Rubin. Also, Rubin testified as to his proposed net distribution of assets based on the 2009 agreements. The arbitrator stopped plaintiffs cross-examination of Rubin, when he determined she attempted to open the issues resolved by the 2009 agreements. During these proceedings, defendant requested a reduction in the amount of his child support, claiming plaintiff no longer incurred child care and counseling costs. Plaintiff objected, asserting defendant failed to show any change of circumstances because the underlying calculation of the child support award and his current income were not disclosed. Finalization of the issue was adjourned pending additional submissions.\nOn December 10, 2010, for the first time, Rubin agreed to meet with plaintiff, her counsel, her accountant and Thomas Hoberman, plaintiffs newly hired forensic accounting expert. Following the meeting Hoberman prepared a report, challenging Rubin’s findings regarding plaintiffs projected 2008 income and identifying errors in his analysis.\nThe arbitrator corresponded with the parties, who had not complied with his directions for further submissions. More specifically, neither party had filed proposed resolutions regarding the outstanding property issues, and defendant had not submitted information supporting his child support modification request. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff renewed her demand for the arbitrator to recuse himself, this time claiming he engaged in ex parte communications with Rubin, in violation of Rule SiS-Sle).\nIn a decision letter, the arbitrator provided a procedure for distributing personalty, noting neither party provided proof of value. He denied plaintiffs request to set aside the 2009 agreements, stating his “communications with Mr. Rubin have been limited to scheduling issues and most recently to correct a factual error[.]” The arbitrator noted defendant had withdrawn his child support modification request; however, he ordered each party to address the basis for the award’s deviation from the child support guidelines. Defendant responded; plaintiff renewed her request to set aside the 2009 agreements. The arbitrator, after reading certifications, made “credibility determinations” and adopted defendant’s explanation of the calculation of the amount of support, Rubin’s recommendation for proposed credits and allocation of debts. In doing so, the arbitrator again drew an adverse inference from plaintiffs omission of the certification of prior counsel regarding his participation in the Rubin conferences. The arbitrator relied on prior counsel’s correspondence sent on behalf of plaintiff, wherein the parties relinquished “any equitable distribution claims against their respective practices only.” The arbitrator again reserved finalization of the allocation of fees and costs.\nRubin submitted a certification supporting the calculation of child support, reporting he met with the parties and their attorneys in the arbitrator’s office on June 24, 2009 (the arbitrator was not present). At that time, Rubin made adjustments to the income figures supplied by the parties’ accountants, calculating plaintiffs and defendant’s 2008 incomes. Rubin found defendant’s annual salary from all sources exceeded plaintiffs by less than $5000. Rubin attached the schedules he had prepared and discussed with the parties at that conference. The schedules were used to fix defendant’s child support obligation and promote the mutual waiver of alimony. Plaintiff again requested the 2009 agreements be voided and discovery reopened based on Hoberman’s March 2, 2011 letter, which rebutted Rubin’s methodology used to calculate plaintiffs projected 2008 income. After correcting what he asserted were errors, Hoberman concluded plaintiffs projected 2008 income would be less than half the sum Rubin calculated.\nOn March 17, 2011, the arbitrator entered an arbitration order incorporating the parties’ 2009 agreements, Rubin’s spreadsheets calculating debits and credits, and the income schedules Rubin prepared supporting the calculation of child support, all of which were attached to the order. The order also directed “the final [arbitration [a]wards/[d]ecision shall be incorporated into an [a]mended [JOD], effective nunc pro tunc to February 4, 2010.” The arbitrator reserved determination of any allocation of counsel, expert, and arbitration fees, pending further submissions by the parties. A subsequent agreement resolved distribution of personal property which also was incorporated in the JOD.\nPlaintiff continued to press her request to vacate the 2009 agreements along with the arbitration orders. Relying on the certification of defendant’s ex-fiancée, Jamie Silverman, plaintiff believed Rubin was not objective and had been aiding defendant. Silverman certified defendant “advised” he actually earned almost twice the sum Rubin had calculated and frequently spoke with Rubin, whom he allegedly referred to as “Uncle Seymour.” Further, Silverman reportedly overheard a telephone conversation between defendant and Rubin, after which defendant informed her Rubin “was going to make sure everything was ‘taken care of.... [A] little birdie told me Seymour got it covered.’ ” Plaintiff sought to subpoena records of Rubin’s telephone communications with defendant.\nDefendant opposed the application and cross-moved for an order requiring plaintiff to “pay 100 percent of the counsel fees and costs incurred by ... defendant for having to respond.” Rubin also submitted a certification denying plaintiffs allegations of bias, refuting the suggestion he merely accepted defendant’s assertions. He explained “[defendant] supplied voluminous credit card information to me for the five years preceding the date of the complaint!.]”\nThe arbitrator issued a decision on July 1, 2011. He found Silverman “[wa]s not completely objective!,]” given her recent break-up with defendant, whereas Rubin was “selected as a neutral accountant by both parties[,]” had “no apparent dog in the race,” and had as many private conversations with plaintiff as with defendant. The arbitrator rejected plaintiffs claims and reserved his decision on defendant’s fee request. Plaintiff subsequently moved for reconsideration, relying on certifications from plaintiffs accountant and Hoberman. Defendant opposed the request and reasserted his demand for payment of his fees. The arbitrator denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.\nIn a separate submission the arbitrator addressed the allocation of fees. Finding “both parties have the income, ability and financial resources to pay counsel and expert fees and the costs of arbitration!,]” the arbitrator held each party responsible for his and her own fees, as well as “50% of the arbitration fees incurred ... and 50% of Mr. Rubin’s fees ... as of December 1, 2009.” However, as for fees incurred after December 1, 2009, the arbitrator found plaintiff “conducted her ... litigation in bad faith” and repeatedly asserted unreasonable positions, which warranted an award to defendant in order to protect him from the costs of unnecessary litigation. The arbitrator allocated $37,000 of Rubin’s post-December 1, 2009 fees to plaintiff, and $9,281.25 to defendant. Further, he awarded defendant $50,000 for his attorney’s work after December 1, 2009, to be paid by plaintiff.\nDefendant moved before the Family Part to confirm the March 17, 2011 arbitration award. Plaintiff cross-moved to vacate the award and all underlying agreements that were incorporated therein. She further requested to terminate services by the arbitrator and Rubin, to reopen discovery, and to select a new arbitrator and expert to “commence de novo arbitration of all financial issues!.]” The judge granted defendant’s motion to confirm the March 17, 2011 award and denied plaintiffs cross-motion in a November 30, 2011 order. A separate motion to confirm the arbitrator’s August 11, 2011 fee award was filed and granted, over plaintiffs objection. In a November 30, 2011 order, the judge also declined plaintiffs motion to stay enforcement pending her appeal and denied defendant’s motion for an additional fee award.\nOn appeal, plaintiff requests we reverse the orders by the court confirming the May 25, 2010, March 17, 2011, and August 11, 2011 awards by the arbitrator, whom she maintains committed misconduct, displayed partiality, and exceeded the scope of arbitral authority.\nII.\nNeither party contests the consensual agreement to submit all financial disputes to binding arbitration. The record supports the parties clearly opted out of judicial review of their matrimonial matter in favor of arbitration. The proceeding’s emphasis on confidentiality, coupled with defendant’s resistance to release of income information, suggest a motive to maintain financial secrecy.\nOn appeal, plaintiff seeks to vacate the arbitration awards and the orders confirming them, emphasizing procedural defects during proceedings conducted by the arbitrator infected the fundamental fairness of the process and resulted in an unconscionable outcome. Before we examine plaintiffs challenges, we need to consider the arbitral forum choice, governed by the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (the Act), N.J.S.A 2A:23B-1 to -32.\n“In New Jersey, arbitration ... is a favored means of dispute resolution.” Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, 187 N.J. 323, 342, 901 A.2d 381 (2006). It is well-settled that New Jersey’s strong public policy favors settlement of disputes through arbitration. Id. at 343, 901 A.2d 381; see also Block v. Plosia, 390 N.J.Super. 543, 551, 916 A.2d 475 (App.Div.2007) (stating the Act “continues our state’s long-standing policy to favor voluntary arbitration as a means of dispute resolution”). Increasingly, parties elect “to side step the judicial process” and enter arbitration agreements in a myriad of areas other than labor-management disputes. Fawzy v. Fawzy, 199 N.J. 456, 477, 973 A.2d 347 (2009). See also Wein v. Morris, 194 N.J. 364, 375-76, 944 A.2d 642 (2008) (“Our courts have long noted our public policy that encourages the use of arbitration proceedings as an alternate forum.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nIn Fawzy, the Supreme Court reinforced the benefits of using arbitration in family litigation, which the Court first discussed in Faherty v. Faherty, 97 N.J. 99, 477 A.2d 1257 (1984). In Faherty, the question considered was the enforceability of an arbitration clause in a separation agreement. Id. at 105, 477 A.2d 1257. The Court concluded:\nIt is fair and reasonable that parties who have agreed to be bound by arbitration in a formal, written separation agreement should be so bound. Rather than frowning on arbitration of alimony disputes, public policy supports it. We recognize that in many cases arbitration of matrimonial disputes may offer an effective alternative method of dispute resolution.\n[Faherty, supra, 97 N.J. at 107, 477 A.2d 1257.]\nA significant advantage of arbitration, likely the controlling motivation in this matter, is “the opportunity for resolution of sensitive matters in a private and informal forum,” rather than presentation of the matter in the public arena of an open courtroom. Id. at 107-08, 477 A.2d 1257. The Court observed:\narbitration conducted in a less formal atmosphere, often in a shorter time span than a trial, and always with a fact-finder of the parties’ own choosing, is often far less antagonistic and nasty than typical courthouse litigation. In sum, the benefits of arbitration in the family law setting appear to be well established.\n[Fawzy, supra 199 N.J. at 472, 973 A.2d 347 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).]\n‘“The object of arbitration is the final disposition, in a speedy, inexpensive, expeditious, and perhaps less formal manner, of the controversial differences between the parties.’ ” Hojnowski, supra, 187 N.J. at 343, 901 A.2d 381 (quoting Carpenter v. Bloomer, 54 N.J.Super. 157, 162, 148 A.2d 497 (App.Div.1959)).\nArbitration is a “creature of contract[.]” Kimm v. Blisset, LLC, 388 N.J.Super. 14, 25, 905 A.2d 887 (App.Div.2006) (citations omitted), certif. denied, 189 N.J. 428, 915 A.2d 1051 (2007). Like its federal counterpart, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.A. § 1-16, the Act strives for uniformity. See N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-29 (“In applying and construing this uniform act, consideration shall be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among States that enact it.”). Accordingly, the Act “recognizes the contractual nature of the arbitration remedy and sets forth the details of the arbitration procedure that will apply unless varied or waived by contract, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-4.” Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 469, 973 A.2d 347. It is understood that “when parties in dissolution proceedings agree to arbitrate their dispute, the general rules governing the conduct of arbitration shall apply, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-1 to -32.” Id. at 480, 973 A.2d 347. Accordingly, “ ‘only those issues may be arbitrated which the parties have agreed shall be.’ ” Id. at 469, 973 A.2d 347 (quoting In re Arbitration Between Grover & Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 80 N.J. 221, 229, 403 A.2d 448 (1979)).\nThe written arbitration agreement may, subject to the restriction of N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-4b, define the arbitration procedures, including the method for initiation of arbitration proceedings, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-9; the manner the process is conducted, N.J.S.A 2A:23B-15; and the issuance of the award, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-19. The Act authorizes courts to recognize and enforce arbitration agreements. N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-5, -6; Spaeth v. Srinivasan, 403 N.J.Super. 508, 513, 959 A.2d 290 (App.Div.2008). In adopting the Act, the Legislature intended to follow the FAA, “which states that arbitration agreements ‘shall be valid[,] irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’ ” Id. at 513 n. 1, 959 A.2d 290 (quoting 9 U.S.C.A. § 2).\nFurther, as discussed in detail below, once parties agree to proceed in an arbitral forum, the court’s role is significantly narrowed. Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 462, 470, 973 A.2d 347. Although, pending the arbitrator’s appointment, the court may act provisionally to address “urgent” relief, see N.J.S.A 2A:23B-8b(2), “[a]fter an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act,” it is the arbitrator who\nmay issue orders for provisional remedies, including interim awards, as ... necessary to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding and to promote the fair and expeditious resolution of the controversy, to the same extent and pursuant to the same conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil aetion[.j\n[.N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-8b(l).].\nThe Act permits a less formal process than a court proceeding. As provided by N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-15a:\nAn arbitrator may conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding. The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing and, among other matters, determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality, and weight of any evidence.\nOnce arbitration commences, the arbitrator may subpoena witnesses or records; permit depositions; permit appropriate discovery to consider, among other things, the “desirability of making the proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost effective”; order compliance with discovery orders or subpoenas the arbitrator issues “and take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this State”; and issue protective orders. N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-17a to e.\nWe underscore this point: when binding arbitration is contracted for by litigants, the judiciary’s role to determine the substantive matters subject to arbitration ends. “Arbitration should spell litigation’s conclusion, rather than its beginning.” N.J. Tpk. Auth. v. Local 196, I.F.P.T.E., 190 N.J. 283, 292, 920 A.2d 88 (2007). “ ‘[I]t is, after all, meant to be a substitute for and not a springboard for litigation.’ ” Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 468, 973 A.2d 347 (quoting Barcon Assocs., Inc. v. Tri-County Asphalt Corp., 86 N.J. 179, 187, 430 A.2d 214 (1981)). From the judiciary’s perspective, once parties contract for binding arbitration, all that remains is the possible need to: enforce orders or subpoena issued by the arbitrator, which have been ignored, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-17(g); confirm the arbitration award, N.J.S.A 2A:23B-22; correct or modify an award, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-24, and in very limited circumstances, vacate an award N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-23. If not for this limitation on judicial intervention of arbitration awards, “the purpose of the arbitration contract, which is to provide an effective, expedient, and fair resolution of disputes, would be severely undermined.” Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 470, 973 A.2d 347 (citing Barcon, supra, 86 N.J. at 187, 430 A.2d 214).\nIt also is well settled that “there is a strong preference for judicial confirmation of arbitration awards.” Linden Bd. of Educ. v. Linden Educ. Ass’n, 202 N.J. 268, 276, 997 A.2d 185 (2010). See also Martindale v. Sandvik, Inc., 173 N.J. 275, 800 A.2d 872 (1993). Consistent with the defined “salutary purposes ... courts grant arbitration awards considerable deference.” Borough of E. Rutherford v. E. Rutherford PBA Local 275, 213 N.J. 190, 201, 61 A.3d 941 (2013).\nIn this matter, plaintiffs requested relief is limited to vacating the arbitration award. “A party seeking to vacate an arbitration award must first obtain trial court review of the award.” Manger v. Manger, 417 N.J.Super. 370, 376, 9 A.3d 1081 (App.Div.2010) (citing Hogoboom v. Hogoboom, 393 N.J.Super. 509, 515, 924 A.2d 602 (App.Div.2007)). The court’s review is informed by the authority bestowed on the arbitrator by the Act. The Act states a court may vacate an arbitration award only upon proof:\n(1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;\n(2) the court finds evident partiality by an arbitrator; corruption by an arbitrator; or misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;\n(3) an arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon showing of sufficient cause for postponement, refused to consider evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to section 15 of this act, so as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;\n(4) an arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator’s powers____\n[N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-23.]\nFurther, “parties may agree to a broader review than provided for by the default provisions in the ... Act.” Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 482 n. 5, 973 A.2d 347. Their agreement must “accurately reflect the circumstances under which a party may challenge the award and the level of review agreed upon.” Ibid.\nFor those who think the parties are entitled to a greater share of justice, and that such justice exists only in the care of the court, ... the parties are free to expand the scope of judicial review by providing for such expansion in their contract; that they may, for example, specifically provide that ... awards may be reversed either for mere errors of New Jersey law, substantial errors, or gross errors of New Jersey law and define therein what they mean by that.\n[Tretina v. Fitzpatrick & Assocs., 135 N.J. 349, 358, 640 A.2d 788 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]\nFinally, a party seeking to vacate an arbitration award bears the burden of demonstrating “fraud, corruption, or similar wrongdoing on the part of the arbitrator ].” Id. at 357, 640 A.2d 788. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Del Piano v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 372 N.J.Super. 503, 510, 859 A.2d 742 (App.Div.2004) (“[Because of the strong judicial presumption in favor of the validity of an arbitral award, the party seeking to vacate it bears a heavy burden.”), certif. granted, 183 N.J. 218, 871 A.2d 95 (2005), appeal dismissed, 195 N.J. 512, 950 A.2d 901 (2005).\nHaving outlined these statutory parameters, we note, “the scope of review of an arbitration award is narrow. Otherwise, the purpose of the arbitration contract, which is to provide an effective, expedient, and fair resolution of disputes, would be severely undermined.” Fawzy, supra, 199 N.J. at 470, 973 A.2d 347 (citing Barcon Assocs., supra, 86 N.J. at 187, 430 A.2d 214). “As the decision to vacate an arbitration award is a decision of law, this court reviews the denial of a motion to vacate an arbitration award de novo.” Manger, supra, 417 N.J.Super. at 376, 9 A.3d 1081 (citation omitted). See also Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, 140 N.J. 366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (holding no “special deference” is accorded the trial judge’s “interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts”).\nIII.\nA.\nPlaintiff advances several arguments for vacating the March 17, 2011 arbitration award. She contends the 2009 agreements were not the product of arbitration and, therefore, should be set aside. Further, she maintains the arbitrator exceeded his powers by acting as both mediator and arbitrator, presided over issues not subject to arbitration, and exercised undue means in repeatedly denying plaintiff access to “relevant financial documents.”\nDefendant counters, stating plaintiffs request to vacate was filed beyond the 120-day window set forth in N.J.S.A 2A:23B-23b. We need not address defendant’s procedural challenge, in light of the fact that the March 17, 2011 arbitration award was not a final, conclusive determination of all issues concluding the arbitration.\nThis case unraveled because the parties agreed to arbitration, then chose to do something else. That said, we analyze what actually occurred resulting in the 2009 agreements and whether our intervention is warranted. Even though the process employed was not an arbitration hearing as envisioned by the Act or as agreed by the parties, we conclude the procedures were not fundamentally unfair, the process was not infirm, and the 2009 agreements need not be vacated.\nRegarding the first agreement to distribute the medical practice, the arbitrator did not participate in the settlement discussions; Rubin had the lead role. The parties tunneled information to him, he made recommendations, the parties’ attorneys and experts asked questions, and a decision to accept, modify or reject the recommendations was individually made. Plaintiff never states she and her original attorney did not discuss these issues, or claims she was deprived of the ability to consider documentation prior to reaching the February 2009 agreement. Rather, her complaint is the documents were not kept by her original attorney and, therefore, were not available to substituted counsel. Plaintiff also complains that when she sought subsequent review of the financial information regarding the business interests she was denied access. We find the process employed did not violate the Act and plaintiffs challenges are insufficient to vacate the agreement dividing the medical practices.\nAlthough parties contract to arbitrate, settlement negotiations are not foreclosed by the Act. See, e.g., N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-15a (authorizing an arbitrator to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing). Indeed, New Jersey courts have found that the “ ‘[settlement of litigation ranks high in [the] public policy’ ” of this State. Puder v. Buechel, 183 N.J. 428, 437, 874 A.2d 534 (2005) (quoting Nolan ex rel. Nolan v. Lee Ho, 120 N.J. 465, 472, 577 A.2d 143 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original)). We have held, “so long as the parties acknowledge that the agreement was reached voluntarily and is for them, at least, fair and equitable” it should be enforced. Lerner v. Laufer, 359 N.J.Super. 201, 217, 819 A.2d 471 (App.Div.2003). “Advancing that public policy is imperative ... where matrimonial proceedings have increasingly overwhelmed the docket.” Puder, supra, 183 N.J. at 430, 874 A.2d 534; see also Davidson v. Davidson, 194 N.J.Super. 547, 550, 477 A.2d 423 (Ch.1984) (“With more divorces being granted now than in history, and with filings on the rise, fair, reasonable, equitable and, to the extent possible, conclusive settlements must be reached, or the inexorable and inordinate passage of time from initiation of suit to final trial will be absolutely devastating[.]”).\nPlaintiffs suggestion she was uninformed is rejected as this record contains no evidence to show her decision dividing the medical practice was not made with full knowledge or was the result of coercion. Plaintiff is a highly educated, successful, professional businesswoman. The parties were married for fourteen years, and, even if some of defendant’s enterprises were founded late in the marital relationship, their existence was disclosed and plaintiff was able to gain necessary information regarding these entities. The circumstances here reflect no disparity in bargaining power between plaintiff and defendant.\nMoreover, plaintiffs agreement, guided by the advice of her independently chosen legal counsel and aided by her individual accountant, was made after reflection on alternatives. In fact, the record shows that immediately following plaintiffs initial acceptance of Rubin’s recommendation, her accountant and attorney repudiated assent, asserting errors were found in Rubin’s calculations. Following further review, plaintiff withdrew her objection and reaffirmed her agreement to be bound, accepting through counsel, the distribution as fair and equitable. The record supports plaintiffs decision was reasoned, voluntary and deliberate, making it a binding contract between the parties.\nThese same reasons uphold the memorandum of understanding reached on July 8, 2009, along with its amendments dated September 22, 2009, and October 15, 2009. These detailed documents, fully executed by the parties and counsel, were not the product of arbitration, but mediation. Following our review, we find no basis to set them aside.\nCertainly, mediation, although a form of alternate dispute resolution, differs from binding arbitration, which raises the next question posed by plaintiff: can parties who agree to proceed in binding arbitration change the process to mediation? We conclude they can. Even though the parties contracted to pursue “binding arbitration,” their change of course to utilize mediation will not invalidate their settlement agreements.\nMediation is governed by the Uniform Mediation Act (UMA), N.J.S.A. 2A:23C-1 to -13, R. 1:40-4, and R. l:40-5(b). Similar to arbitration, mediation provides an alternate, more informal forum than litigation, allowing confidential and candid exchange of information between the parties and the mediator to aid the parties’ efforts in reaching an accord on disputes. Mediated agreements, like other contracts, must be knowingly and voluntarily reached. A settlement agreement, reached in mediation, which is incorporated into an executed, signed written agreement is enforceable. Willingboro Mall, Ltd. v. 240/242 Franklin Ave., L.L.C., 215 N.J. 242, 250-51, 263, 71 A.3d 888 (2013).\nThe July 8, 2009 memorandum of understanding executed by the parties is direct and expressly states:\nThis Memorandum between [the parties] shall describe the outline of an Agreement that was reached between the parties on July 8, 2009 after mediation with the assistance of [the arbitrator] and [Rubin].\nThis Memorandum is the result of many months of negotiations and many conferences with [the arbitrator] and Mr. Rubin. The parties are entering into this Memorandum freely and voluntarily after conferring with their attorneys and anyone else with whom they wish to confer. The parties agree that this Memorandum represents a fair compromise of the issues. They acknowledge that by entering into this Memorandum they are waiving their rights to participate in [the] Arbitration hearing and waive the right to have the issues set forth in this Memorandum decided by the Arbitrator.\nThe amendment further provides “the parties agree to the foregoing freely and voluntarily.”\nDespite her protests, plaintiff offers no evidence to repudiate these pronouncements. Nothing supports the failure of the parties to exchange necessary information. See R. 1:40-5(b)(3) (“In mediation of economic aspects of family actions, parties are required to provide accurate and complete information to the mediator and to each other, including but not limited to tax returns, Case Information Statements, and appraisal reports.”). Also, the mediation agreement satisfies the prerequisites for enforcement as the terms were incorporated into a written document signed and distributed to all parties. Willingboro Mall, supra, 215 N.J. at 263, 71 A.3d 888. Our review of this record unearths no basis to undo the consensual 2009 agreements.\nWe also reject plaintiffs claims of legal insufficiency. Although we agree, for example, the child support agreement omitted a baseline determination, that fact may cause future proof problems if modification is sought, but it alone would not void the agreement.\nPlaintiff points to Hoberman’s analysis of her projected 2008 income to suggest the alimony and child support provisions in the 2009 agreements must be vacated. We conclude if plaintiffs projected income were inaccurate, standing alone that fact is insufficient to vacate the July 8, 2009 agreement.\nFirst, the support award was not simply a guidelines calculation. Necessary information required by N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23a, includes not only plaintiffs income, but also defendant’s income, the children’s needs, and other funds available, including any income or assets of the children.\nSecond, the support calculation did not stand alone as the agreement as a whole integrated settlement of both support and various equitable distribution issues. Often these matters are “interrelated” amidst compromise of parties’ myriad economic concerns. Lehr v. Afflitto, 382 N.J.Super. 376, 396, 889 A.2d 462 (App.Div.2006). See also Lynn v. Lynn, 165 N.J.Super. 328, 342, 398 A.2d 141 (App.Div.) (noting the necessary interrelationship between property distribution, alimony and child support), certif. denied, 81 N.J. 52, 404 A.2d 1152 (1979). “[T]he termination of a marriage involves an ‘economic mosaic’ comprised of equitable distribution, alimony and child support and ... these financial components interface.” Koelble v. Koelble, 261 N.J.Super. 190, 192, 618 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1992).\nThird, plaintiffs argument does not explain how Hoberman’s conclusions affect the final overall result. Hoberman refuted Rubin’s inclusion of certain items in the 2008 income projections, but he did not specify plaintiffs actual reported 2008 income or compare it to Rubin’s projected computations.\nFourth, even if Rubin’s calculations of plaintiffs income were wrong, it is well established that significant changes in circumstances warrant review and potential modification of a child support award. Lepis v. Lepis, 83 N.J. 139, 145, 416 A.2d 45 (1980). Therefore, were plaintiff to prove such a change along with the children’s needs, the support amount could be altered.\nAs a result of our review, we decline to vacate the 2009 agreements, finding unfounded plaintiffs claims that the procedures followed to reach them were defective or her acceptance unreliable. As noted, the parties agreed to mediate and conduct settlement discussions, rather than commence an arbitration hearing. That procedure is permissible and the agreements are enforceable.\nB.\nWe turn to plaintiffs next challenge asserting the arbitrator’s change of role to a facilitator of a mediated agreement obviated his ability to thereafter proceed as an arbitrator. Plaintiff argues the arbitrator “committed misconduct and exceeded his powers by acting as both a mediator and an arbitrator.” She further explains the arbitrator aided mediation of the disputes, then, when she sought underlying documentation, he “enforced the [agreements] that he had written [as a mediator] as if they were the result of an actual arbitration,” converting the result to a binding arbitration award. This is an issue of first impression.\nOur review considers the compatibility of the same party assuming the role of mediator and arbitrator. Mediation and arbitration both allow for resolution of disputes outside the court process, and the hallmark of a mediator and an arbitrator is neutrality. See R. 1:40 — 2(1)(a)(1) (defining arbitration as “[a] process by which each party and/or its counsel presents its case to a neutral third party, who then renders a specific award”). Nevertheless, we conclude the differences in the roles of these two types of dispute resolution professionals necessitate that a mediator, who may become privy to party confidences in guiding disputants to a mediated resolution, cannot thereafter retain the appearance of a neutral factfinder necessary to conduct a binding arbitration proceeding. Consequently, absent the parties’ agreement, an arbitrator appointed under the Act may not assume the role of mediator and, thereafter, resume the role of arbitrator.\nMediation is included as a “Facilitative Process[,]” which is defined as “a process by which a mediator facilitates communication between parties in an effort to promote settlement without imposition of the mediator’s own judgment regarding the issues in dispute.” R. 1:40 — 2(c). “A mediator, although neutral, often takes an active role in promoting candid dialogue by identifying issues [and] encouraging parties to accommodate each other[’s] interests.” Lehr, supra, 382 N.J.Super. at 394, 889 A.2d 462 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original); see also James R. Coben & Peter N. Thompson, “Disputing Irony: A Systematic Look at Litigation About Mediation,” 11 Harv. Negot. L. Rev. 43 (“ ‘As a facilitator, a mediator is not tasked with reaching a final decision in a matter, but rather instills trust and confidence of the participants in the mediation process, allowing them to resolve their differences.’” (quoting V.J.L. v. Red, 39 P.3d 1110, 1113 n. 3 (Wyo.2002))).\nMediations are not conducted under oath, do not follow traditional rules of evidence, and are not limited to developing the facts. Admittedly, mediation encourages confidential disclosures to the mediator, whose training is designed to utilize these confidential positions to aid the parties to evaluate their positions, promote understanding of the other side’s position, and reach a consensus. These confidences are “insured only if the participants trust that information conveyed to the mediator will remain in confidence.” Lehr, supra, 382 N.J.Super. at 395, 889 A.2d 462. “Mediation communications, which ‘would not exist but for the settlement attempt,’ are made by parties ‘without the expectation that they will later be bound by them.’ ” State v. Williams, 184 N.J. 432, 447, 877 A.2d 1258 (2005) (quoting Michael L. Prigoff, Toward Candor or Chaos: The Case of Confidentiality in Mediation, 12 Seton Hall Legis. J. 2, 13 (1988)). “Successful mediation, with its emphasis on conciliation, depends on confidentiality perhaps more than any other form of [alternate dispute resolution].” Williams, supra, 184 N.J. at 447, 877 A.2d 1258 (citation omitted). “Indeed, mediation stands in stark contrast to formal adjudication, and [ ] arbitration, in which the avowed goal is to uncover and present evidence of claims and defenses in an adversarial setting.” Ibid.\nOn the other hand, an arbitrator’s role is evaluative, requiring the parties to present their evidence for a final determination. See R. 1:40-2(b)(2) (defining “Evaluative Process” to include “Neutral Fact Finding: A process by which a neutral, agreed upon by the parties, investigates and analyzes a dispute involving complex or technical issues, and who then makes nonbinding findings and recommendations.”). Arbitrators essentially weigh evidence, assess credibility, and apply the law when determining whether a party has proven his or her request for relief. See Lela P. Love, Symposium: The Top Ten Reasons Why Mediators Should Not Evaluate, 24 Fla. St. U.L.Rev. 937, 938 (1997). An arbitrator makes a final decision, which binds the parties. See N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-1 (defining an “arbitrator” as “an individual appointed ... to render an award ... in a controversy that is subject to an agreement to arbitrate”). Thus, “arbitrators should conduct the proceedings in an evenhanded manner and treat all parties with equality and fairness at all stages of the proceedings.” Barcon, supra, 86 N.J. at 190, 430 A.2d 214 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nToward this end, the Act vests arbitrators with broad discretion over discovery and other procedural matters to “conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding. The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties ... before the hearing[.]” N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-15a. The statute’s broad conferral of authority “does not require any particular procedures, mandate discovery, compel the maintenance of a record, command a statement by the arbitrator regarding his findings and conclusions, or an expression of the reasons why he reached the result that he did[,]” unless expressly required under the parties’ arbitration agreement. Johnson v. Johnson, 204 N.J. 529, 546, 9 A.3d 1003 (2010) (citing N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-1 to -32).\nWhile we recognize the Act envisions a need for flexibility to meet a wide variety of situations presented in arbitration proceedings, we are not persuaded the Act intended an appointed arbitrator may first assume the role of mediator then switch back to conduct final arbitration hearings. As noted, an effective mediator gains each party’s confidence and offers advice to steer them toward settlement. Those confidential communications gained in mediation are precluded from being considered in a court contest, Isaacson v. Isaacson, 348 N.J.Super. 560, 577, 792 A.2d 525 (App.Div.), certif. denied, 174 N.J. 364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002), and would similarly be precluded from consideration in an arbitration hearing. See also Willingboro Mall, supra, 215 N.J. at 245 (“Communications made during the course of a mediation are generally privileged and therefore inadmissible in another proceeding.”).\nIn researching this issue, we found limited discussion of the subject. Initially, we are aware Rule l:40-2(d) identifies as a “Hybrid Process” of complementary dispute resolution “[m]ediation-arbitration,” which it defined as “[a] process by which, after an initial mediation, unresolved issues are then arbitrated.” The rule does not address whether the same party may perform both functions or whether issues attempted to be mediated may then be arbitrated.\nIn Isaacson, we discussed the efficacy of assuming the dual role of custody mediator and guardians ad litem (GAL), examining the applicable court rules governing appointments of custody and parenting time mediators, R. 1:40-5(a) and GALs, R. 5:8B. We noted Rule 1:40-5(c) specifies a custody and parenting time mediator may not subsequently act as an evaluator in the proceeding or make any recommendation to the court respecting the issues. Isaacson, supra, 348 N.J.Super. at 577, 792 A.2d 525. We concluded “[a] practical reading of the rules and common sense preclude[d] the [possible] dual role of mediator and GAL.” Id. at 575, 792 A.2d 525. We find Isaacson’s distinction between an evaluative versus faeilitative role helpful.\nCanon IV.H of the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes, approved by the American Bar Association and the American Arbitration Association, states “an arbitrator should not be present or otherwise participate in the settlement discussions unless requested to do so by all parties. An arbitrator should not exert pressure on any party to settle.” This guideline is also directed to the evaluator-facilitator dichotomy. Despite the code’s applicability to commercial matters, such a concern certainly exists and may even be heightened in the arbitration of an emotionally charged matrimonial matter.\nWe uncovered one regulatory provision presumably suggesting an appointed arbitrator may mediate or assist the parties to reach a settlement during compulsory interest arbitration to resolve collective bargaining disputes between police and fire departments and their employees. N.J.A.C. 19:16-5.7(c). However, upon examination of the statutory authority governing the regulation, we find a marked distinction between the two proceedings, as the statute requires: “Any mediation or factfinding invoked pursuant to ... this section shall terminate immediately upon the filing of a petition for arbitration.” N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(b)(2). Again, the distinction between the roles of the facilitator in a mediation and the factfinder in an arbitration is important.\nBased on our review of the distinctly different proceedings of arbitration and mediation, we conclude the positions of arbitrator and mediator are in conflict. An arbitrator must “maintain ‘broad public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the [arbitration] process.’ ” Barcon, supra, 86 N.J. at 190, 430 A.2d 214 (quoting Holtzmann, The First Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes, 33 The Business Lawyer 309, 312 (1977)). If the same person acts as a mediator, obtains party confidences or offers opinions on the issues in dispute, a conflict arises were he or she to then switch roles to act as an arbitrator, making the final call. We find the need for an arbitrator’s complete objectivity bears heavily on the integrity of the arbitration process. This concern becomes even more problematic when arbitrating matrimonial disputes between already suspicious adverse parties.\nIn the family law context, we could envision parties agreeing in writing to allow one person to perform these roles regarding separate issues; for example, mediation of custody matters and arbitration of financial issues. However, this should be the parties’ choice. Absent a specific agreement clearly defining and accepting the complementary dispute resolution professional’s roles, dual roles are to be avoided.\nIt is advisable for parties to exhaust all applicable dispute resolution alternatives, including settlement conferences and mediation before undertaking arbitration. Once these available courses are exhausted and arbitration is chosen, the arbitrator should promptly commence hearings and resolve matters expeditiously.\nIn this matter, the arbitrator disavowed any mediation role, suggesting he merely performed conferencing. The record supports the arbitrator’s position regarding the agreement dividing the parties’ medical practices. Unfortunately, however, we cannot reach that same conclusion in light of the unequivocal introductory paragraph contained in the July 8, 2009 memorandum of understanding, which is described as “an Agreement that was reached between the parties ... after mediation with the assistance of [the arbitrator and Rubin].” The agreement’s terms place the arbitrator in the role of moving the parties toward compromise in mediation. We will not infer that the written document is inartful or accept the suggestion the arbitrator merely brought to bear his informed judgment in order to reach a fair solution. Rather, we can only conclude the agreement means what it says: it is a product of mediation reached with the assistance of both the arbitrator and Rubin.\nBased on our determination, absent the parties’ contract to the contrary, once a neutral assumes the role of mediator, he or she may not assume the role of arbitrator. Therefore, any “arbitration awards” based on the arbitrator’s finding, entered following the 2009 mediated agreements must be set aside. After guiding mediation, the arbitrator could no longer proceed, and by doing so here, he exceeded his powers. N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-23a(4).\nApplying this holding to the entered arbitration awards, we reach the following conclusions. The November 30, 2011 Family Division order confirming the August 11, 2011 arbitration order adjudicating the award of counsel fees and costs is vacated. Next, examining the March 17, 2011 arbitration award, paragraph (1) adopts Rubin’s allocation of credits and disposition of marital assets, which the parties agreed to accept. Although reached during arbitration after the 2009 mediations, the provisions adopt a settlement agreement and were not the product of the arbitrator’s determination. Paragraphs (2) through (5) entered the parties’ 2009 agreements as final. For the reasons set forth earlier in our opinion upholding the parties’ 2009 agreements, these provisions need not be disturbed. Paragraph (7), like paragraph (1), included a post-mediation agreement for a credit due plaintiff, not an arbitration award and may stand. Paragraphs (6), (8), (10) through (13) are procedural provisions, which also need not be set aside. Only paragraph (9) of the March 17, 2001 arbitration award, addressing the underlying calculation of child support, represents a post-mediation award made by the arbitrator, which must be vacated.\nThe Family Division’s August 19, 2011 order, which confirmed the March 17, 2011 arbitration award is vacated, to the extent the order confirmed paragraph (9) of the arbitration award. However, we need not set aside confirmation provisions incorporating the parties’ 2009 agreements into the JOD.\nAlso, we vacate the provisions in the July 16, and September 23, 2010 Family Part’s orders confirming the arbitrator’s awards that conflict with the provisions of this opinion. Specifically, the provisions adopting the arbitrator’s denial of plaintiffs document requests and confirm the May 25, 2010 arbitration decision, excepting, however, those provisions regarding the 2009 agreements.\nThe matter is remanded to the Family Part for the sole purpose of supervising the parties’ selection of a new arbitrator, to conduct arbitration proceedings under the Act to determine unresolved financial issues, that are not otherwise covered by their mediated and other settlement agreements.\nThe final issue for discussion centers on plaintiffs request for financial disclosure following the execution of the 2009 agreements. We are at a loss to understand why this request was met with such resistance, in light of the express terms of the arbitration agreement and the parties’ protective order.\nThe record contains no agreement to limit copying or review of the other side’s financial disclosures rendered to Rubin. Rather, the documents governing arbitration gave plaintiff the absolute right to copy all relevant information. Specifically, the appended statement of rights of arbitrating parties included “the right to be provided copies of all documents presented to the [arbitrator by their spouse.” Further, the protective order allowed the documents to be reviewed by the parties along with their counsel and experts. Allowing review of the documents would not have caused incessant delay, but rather would have allowed substituted counsel the opportunity to become informed.\nA concern often arises that post-settlement remorse may motivate a party to retract a valid agreement. However, such tactics can effectively be thwarted through sanctions or an award of attorney’s fees for frivolous conduct. See N.J.S.A 2A:23B-21 (affording arbitrator’s authority to award exemplary relief and reasonable attorney’s fees). Further, the request could have been temporally conditioned, and payment for Rubin’s time could have been allocated solely to plaintiff.\nDefendant relies on our decision in Manger, to suggest an arbitrator’s discovery decisions must be upheld. Certain discovery limitations must be made in “the interest of making the hearing ‘fair, expeditious, and cost effective!.]’ ” Manger, supra, 417 N.J.Super. at 376, 9 A.3d 1081 (quoting N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-17c). In Manger, we reviewed defendant’s claim of misconduct alleging the arbitrator improperly denied submission of expert evaluations of the parties’ business. Id. at 374, 9 A.3d 1081. We found no basis to disturb the arbitrator’s award, upholding “the arbitrator’s broad authority to conduct the proceeding!)]” Id. at 377, 9 A.3d 1081. However, the facts in Manger are distinguishable. The arbitrator in that ease had determined to follow pre-arbitration orders that were entered by the Family Part, which included a deadline for submission of expert evaluations. Id. at 373, 9 A.3d 1081.\nConsistent with her authority to “conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding,” N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-15(a), the arbitrator could have ignored or revised the orders entered in the trial court. On the other hand, the arbitrator could apply any and all orders previously entered in the trial court and fashion new discovery and case management orders for the arbitration proceeding. Here, the arbitrator exercised her broad authority to follow the latter course.\n[Id. at 376, 9 A.3d 1081.]\nMore important, “the arbitrator provided an opportunity for each party to identify and exchange the documents on which they intended to rely at the hearing.” Id. at 377, 9 A.3d 1081.\nHere, although there was some review of documentation, Rubin and the parties’ counsel apparently had not retained the considered information. When plaintiffs substituted counsel sought to gain background for the underlying agreements, the arbitrator denied the request and restrained Rubin from further discussion of those issues with substituted counsel. As a result of these determinations, substituted counsel faced an untenable and even suspicious situation, precluding her from providing informed advice to her client and prompting repeated motions to reopen discovery.\nA court may vacate an arbitration award when it is procured by undue means or resulted from an arbitrator exceeding his designated powers. N.J.S.A 2A:24-8a. The judicial inquiry must consider more than whether a mere mistake occurred. Tretina, supra, 135 N.J. at 356-57, 640 A.2d 788 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, that\nformulation requires that the arbitrator[ ] must have clearly intended to decide according to law, must have clearly mistaken the legal rule, and that mistake must appear on the face of the award. In addition, the error, to be fatal, must result in a failure of intent or be so gross as to suggest fraud or misconduct.\n[Id. at 357, 640 A.2d 788 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]\nAlthough we agree the arbitrator properly determined discovery would not be reopened, we cannot similarly uphold the order precluding plaintiff from obtaining documents to which she was unquestionably entitled. The contract to arbitrate specifically granted plaintiff this right and nothing reflects she waived that right. Barring substituted counsel from this information represents an egregious remaking of the arbitration contract, which cannot stand. The Family Part’s order confirming this determination must also be vacated. Once appointed, the new arbitrator shall consider plaintiffs document requests, in light of our opinion.\nTo the extent plaintiff has presented arguments not specifically addressed in our opinion, we reject them as lacking sufficient merit to warrant discussion. R. 2:3 — 11(e)(1)(E).\nWe close with these observations. Arbitration, particularly binding arbitration, must be purposefully chosen, and the parameters must be designated in a contract between the parties. If binding arbitration is selected as the forum for resolution of disputes, a litigant cannot jump back and forth between the court and the arbitral forum. By its very nature, arbitration does not permit such a hybrid system. Further, arbitration “should be a fast and inexpensive way to achieve final resolution of ... disputes and not merely a way-station on route to the courthouse,” Borough of E. Rutherford, supra, 213 N.J. at 201, 61 A.3d 941 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Attempts to return to the court, except to confirm the final arbitration award, are at odds with this objective.\nIn the matter at bar, the parties’ contract concisely defined matters to be addressed in arbitration, yet from commencement, the Family Part maintained involvement such as scheduling case management and entertaining a motion for a protective order, both of which fall directly within the adjudicatory responsibilities of the arbitrator. N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-17e. More over, the parties held a mistaken belief that court intervention was permitted to check the decisions of the arbitrator. This is untenable. The Act’s provisions are unmistakable: once binding arbitration is chosen and the arbitrator(s) named, the court is no longer involved in reviewing or determining the substantive issues. The court’s role is circumscribed to confirm a final arbitration award, correct obvious errors, and consider whether the award should be vacated, only when one of the limited bases set forth in N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-23 has occurred. The piecemeal approach demonstrated here prolonged the final result and eliminated the main benefit of arbitration, “to provide an effective, expedient, and fair resolution of disputes[.]” Fawzy, swpra, 199 N.J. at 470, 973 A.2d 347 (citations omitted).\nFinally, had the parties actually followed the path of binding arbitration, the need for a PSA would be obviated because an issued arbitration award would be confirmed by court order assuring compliance. No separate agreement memorializing the order is needed. Insistence upon preparation of a PSA appears to result from habit, not necessity.\nLastly, we do not mean to suggest parties who seek to arbitrate disputes should abandon all hope of amicable resolution. We urge parties to exhaust possible settlement alternatives prior to contracting for arbitration. If arbitration is accepted, parameters for settlement discussions should be set by the arbitrator.\nIV.\nIn summary, the parties’ agreements dated February, (incorporated by a Family Part order dated April 1), July 8, September 22, and October 15, 2009 are valid and enforceable. The custody and parenting time consent order reached on February 4, 2010 also is not challenged and remains unchanged. Consequently, the March 8, 2010 JOD as originally filed need not be disturbed because it adopts the 2009 agreements reached and finalized the custody agreement. The JOD further accepts the parties’ agreed allocation of debits and credits. The arbitration record suggests this issue was also settled, not resolved by orders following an arbitra tion hearing. That resolution, occurring after the arbitrator’s disqualification, stands on its own as a voluntary agreement.\nWe vacate the trial court’s November 30, 2011 confirmation of the August 11, 2011 arbitration award, allocating attorney’s fees and costs as it was rendered following what we have identified arbitrators’ unauthorized action. These issues along with any unresolved financial matters, and consideration of release of financial documents shall be addressed by the new arbitrator, once chosen by the parties.\nA'firmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.\nRule 5:3-3(e) provides ”[t]he expert shall not communicate with the court except upon prior notice to the parties and their attorneys who shall be afforded an opportunity to be present and to be heard during any such communication between the expert and the court.” However, nothing in the retainer agreement prohibits the expert's communication with the arbitrator, and, in fact, the agreement expressly permits discretionary rule relaxation.\nThe Court has also instructed an arbitration award may be vacated where it violates \"a clear mandate of public policyf.]” Weiss v. Carpenter, 143 N.J. 420, 443, 672 A.2d 1132 (1996). However, such intervention is appropriate only where \"the public-policy question is not reasonably debatablef.]” Ibid.\nThe record is not entirely clear, but it appears Rubin reviewed submissions from each side, which he returned after issuing his recommendation.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE LaVECCHIA\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis Court has acknowledged that a reasonable mistake of fact on the part of a police officer will not render a search or arrest predicated on that mistake unconstitutional. See State v. Handy, 206 N.J. 39, 53-54, 18 A.3d 179 (2011). In this matter, a police officer pulled over a car under the belief that the vehicle was in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66 because one of the vehicle’s taillights was not operational. The trial court determined that the officer was mistaken about the law and granted defendant’s motion to suppress the fruits of the motor vehicle stop. The Appellate Division reversed. The panel determined that the relevant motor vehicle statutes were ambiguous and that, applying the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 530, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014), the officer’s stop of defendant’s car constituted at most an objectively reasonable mistake of law that should be treated in the same manner as a mistake of fact. Accordingly, the panel held that the officer’s mistake of law did not require suppression of the motor vehicle stop.\nWe now reverse. The Appellate Division erred in concluding that the holding in Heien is applicable here. Because the motor vehicle statutes pertinent here are not ambiguous, we need not consider importing Heien into the determination of this matter. Thus, we do not address the arguments raised herein that Helen’s mistake-of-law analysis is not reconcilable with our state constitutional jurisprudence. The officer’s stop of defendant’s motor vehicle was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law that gave rise to constitutional reasonable suspicion; the stop was therefore unconstitutional. We remand to the Appellate Division for its consideration of the State’s alternative argument, which the panel did not reach, that the stop should be sustained based on the community caretaking doctrine.\nI.\nA.\nAt the suppression hearing in this matter, the following facts were adduced. Officer Michael Carletta of the Mount Olive Police Department was the sole witness.\nAt about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of February 3, 2014, Officer Carletta was on motor vehicle patrol traveling southbound on Route 206. A Toyota Camry passed him traveling northbound. Looking in his rearview mirror, the officer observed that the northbound vehicle appeared to have a malfunctioning taillight. Although the vehicle had four taillights in total, two on each side, and although only one light on the rear passenger side was not illuminated, Officer Carletta believed that the vehicle was in violation of the motor vehicle code. He made a U-turn and began to follow the vehicle. After confirming that one of the vehicle’s taillights was not illuminated, he executed a motor vehicle stop. Officer Carletta testified that, in such situations, it is typical police practice to give the driver a warning rather than a summons.\nAfter stopping and approaching the vehicle, Officer Carletta asked the driver, defendant Ryan Sutherland, for his driver’s license, motor vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Defendant initially stated that he did not have his driver’s license with him but then quickly admitted that he did not have a valid driver’s license. After obtaining defendant’s name and date of birth, Officer Carletta returned to his vehicle to check defendant’s information with police dispatch.\nUpon confirming that defendant’s license was in fact suspended, Officer Carletta issued defendant two summonses: driving with a suspended license in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-40, and failure to maintain the vehicle’s “lamps” in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Officer Carletta explained to defendant that he had been stopped because one of his taillights was not working and that he could no longer drive the vehicle because he had a suspended driver’s license. The officer allowed defendant to leave the scene on the condition that his passenger drive the car to its intended destination.\nB.\nOn June 2, 2014, defendant was charged in municipal court with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26. A Morris County grand jury later indicted defendant and charged him with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension for a second or subsequent driving-while-intoxicated conviction in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).\nDefendant filed a motion to suppress the traffic stop and to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the traffic stop constituted an unreasonable seizure because his vehicle had three operable taillights, in compliance with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66. The State countered that the stop was lawful because the malfunctioning taillight provided Officer Carletta with reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle and because the stop was lawful under the “community caretaking” function by which police officers engage in protecting public safety. Officer Carletta testified at the hearing that he had stopped the vehicle both because he believed that any malfunctioning taillight constituted a violation of the statute and because he was engaging in community caretak-ing by letting defendant know that his vehicle was not in proper working order.\nThe trial court granted defendant’s motion to suppress evidence resulting from the motor vehicle stop, but the court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of faulty instructions provided to the grand jury. On the motor vehicle stop, the trial court agreed with defendant that Officer Carletta’s understanding of the maintenance-of-lamps statute had been “incorrect” and that defendant had not violated the statute because he had at least one functioning taillight on each side of the vehicle. Relying heavily on State v. Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. 378, 878 A.2d 857 (App. Div. 2005), as well as an unpublished 2009 Appellate Division decision, the trial court concluded that Officer Carletta’s erroneous interpretation of the law—even though it was a “common sense” and “practical” approach to interpreting the statute—could not pass constitutional scrutiny.\nThe State sought leave to appeal on the grounds that (1) Officer Carletta had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop; (2) Puzioâs continuing vitality was put into question by the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Heien, in which the Supreme Court held that objectively reasonable mistakes of law can provide the reasonable suspicion necessary for a constitutional stop; and (3) the stop was lawful under the community caretaking doctrine. The Appellate Division granted leave to appeal and reversed the trial court in a published opinion. State v. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. 358, 138 A.3d 551 (2016).\nRelying extensively on Heien, the panel determined that “even if the officer was mistaken that the inoperable tail light constituted a Title 39 violation, he had an objectively reasonable basis for stopping defendant’s vehicle.” Id. at 360, 138 A.3d 551. In reaching that conclusion, the panel questioned the continuing vitality of Puzio, which had held “that where an officer mistakenly believes that driving conduct constitutes a violation of the law, but in actuality it does not, no objectively reasonable basis exists upon which to justify a vehicle stop.” Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 383, 878 A.2d 857 (collecting cases). The panel reasoned that Puzio had been decided before Heien and that Heien’s “well-reasoned” holding had cast doubt on Puzio’s continuing validity. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 366-67, 138 A.3d 551. The panel went on to conclude that the statute at issue here was ambiguous and that even if Officer Carletta’s interpretation of the statute was an objectively reasonable mistake of law, the stop was permissible pursuant to Heien “[bjecause the Fourth Amendment tolerates objectively reasonable mistakes of law.” Id. at 368-70, 138 A.3d 551. The panel’s reasoning made it unnecessary to reach the State’s argument about the applicability of the community caretak-ing doctrine. Id. at 371, 138 A.3d 551.\nDefendant sought leave to appeal from this Court, which we granted. 228 N.J. 246, 156 A.3d 167 (2016). We also granted the motion of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) to appear as amicus curiae.\nII.\nThe parties’ arguments are largely those advanced in the proceedings before the trial and appellate courts.\nDefendant argues that the Appellate Division’s adoption of Heien is at odds with prior New Jersey precedent, which has traditionally provided greater protections under our state analogue to the Fourth Amendment than those provided by the Federal Constitution. Specifically, he argues that Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 383, 878 A.2d 857, correctly held that a traffic stop based on an incorrect interpretation of law can never be objectively reasonable. That holding, defendant argues, is a natural extension of this Court’s decision in State v. Novembrino, 105 N.J. 95, 519 A.2d 820 (1987), which held that our State Constitution does not contemplate good faith mistakes by law enforcement as an exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant also contends that the statutory provisions at issue here were plain and unambiguous and did not apply to his vehicle, undermining any basis for reasonable suspicion. In essence, defendant’s argument challenges Officer Carletta’s interpretation of those provisions as not reasonable.\nThe State argues that the Appellate Division correctly held that Officer Carletta’s belief that defendant was in violation of the motor vehicle code was objectively reasonable and provided him with reasonable suspicion to stop defendant’s vehicle. Relying on Heien, the State posits that just as we have held that reasonable mistakes of fact can pass constitutional scrutiny, so too should we hold that reasonable mistakes of law do not run afoul of our constitution. Such a result is not inconsistent with Puzio, the State argues, because Puzio involved an objectively unreasonable mistake of law, whereas here, Officer Carletta was forced to interpret a confusing and outdated set of statutes ambiguous enough to be open to differing and equally reasonable interpretations. Additionally, the State maintains that it preserved its argument that Officer Carletta had lawful authority to stop defendant’s vehicle based on the community caretaking doctrine, which provides police with the power to ensure the safety and welfare of the public independent of their law enforcement objectives.\nAmicus curiae ACLU-NJ argues that the statutes at issue here are not ambiguous and that the rule of lenity requires strict construction of those statutes in defendant’s favor. ACLU-NJ further argues that a stop based on a police officer’s misunderstanding or ignorance of the law can and should be differentiated from mistakes of fact, and that such ignorance or misunderstanding of the law must always be unreasonable and thus unconstitutional under our Article I, Paragraph 7 jurisprudence. Like defendant, ACLU-NJ maintains that that conclusion flows naturally from state constitutional case law, most specifically from Novem-brino. Heien, the ACLU-NJ argues, is inconsistent with that jurisprudence and thus should not be adopted by this Court.\nIII.\nA.\nUnder previous case law in this state, a police officer’s objectively reasonable mistake of fact does not render a search or arrest unconstitutional. Consistent with federal jurisprudence, we have held that Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution provides “room ... for some mistakes [by police].” Handy, 206 N.J. at 54, 18 A.3d 179 (second alteration in original) (quoting Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 186, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990)). However, that principle applies only when “the police ... behave[ ] reasonably.” Ibid.; see also State v. Green, 318 N.J. Super. 346, 352-53, 723 A.2d 1012 (App. Div. 1999) (holding reasonable but mistaken belief leading to arrest did not warrant suppression).\nIn Handy, a police dispatcher, erroneously relying on a record of a warrant containing a name and date of birth that did not match the defendant’s reported information, advised a police officer to execute that warrant without taking necessary steps to clarify discrepancies. 206 N.J. at 41-42, 18 A.3d 179. Our Court concluded that the dispatcher’s conduct was not objectively reasonable. Id. at 54, 18 A.3d 179. Therefore, we determined that the arrest violated the defendant’s federal and state constitutional rights, and we suppressed the evidence found during the search incident to the arrest. Id. at 42, 18 A.3d 179.\nThe facts in Handy led us to a different conclusion than the mistake of fact in State v. Green, in which the error was determined to be objectively reasonable. In Green, which we cited approvingly in Handy, the Appellate Division upheld an arrest and search of defendant Green, where Green closely matched the description of another man named Lovett—for whom the warrant was issued—and where the police encountered Green outside Lovett’s residence. Green, 318 N.J. Super. at 352-53, 723 A.2d 1012. In those circumstances the Appellate Division rightly concluded that the arrest was premised on an objectively reasonable mistake of fact and was thus lawful. Ibid.\nUntil the Appellate Division decision in this case, the jurisprudence of our state appellate courts had not held that reasonable mistakes of law would pass constitutional muster. In fact, courts had reached the opposite conclusion. See Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 382-83, 878 A.2d 857.\nIn Puzio, an officer stopped a moving vehicle with commercial license plates, believing the driver was operating it in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:4-46(a) because the vehicle had no placard on the right side of the vehicle displaying the name and address of its business. Id. at 380, 878 A.2d 857. The Appellate Division determined as a matter of law that the stop was in error because the statute relied on by the officer plainly excluded “passenger vehicles,” like the one driven by the defendant, from the “placard” requirement. Id. at 382-84, 878 A.2d 857.\nImportantly, the Puzio decision noted “a clear distinction between the present situation and those presented in cases where the officer correctly understands the statute but arguably misinterprets the facts concerning whether a vehicle, or operator, has violated the statute.” Id. at 382, 878 A.2d 857. In explaining its reasoning, the panel stated that “[i]f officers were permitted to stop vehicles where it is objectively determined that there is no legal basis for their action, ‘the potential for abuse of traffic infractions as pretext for effecting stops seems boundless and the costs to privacy rights excessive.’” Id. at 384, 878 A.2d 857 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Valdez, 178 F.3d 282, 289 (5th Cir. 1999)). The panel also viewed the creation of an exception for a mistake of law as inconsistent with the exclusionary rule because “it would remove the incentive for police to make certain that they properly understand the law that they are entrusted to enforce and obey.” Ibid. (quoting United States v. Lopez-Soto, 205 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2000)).\nAnother mistake-of-fact case—the State’s assertions to the contrary notwithstanding—is State v. Williamson, 138 N.J. 302, 650 A.2d 348 (1994). Williamson dealt with a police officer’s reasonable suspicion that a motorist had “affected traffic” so as to be in violation of the motor vehicle code by failing to use a turn signal. Id. at 303-04, 650 A.2d 348. The officer was required to make a judgment that involved interpreting facts, namely whether the motorist had actually affected traffic; there was no mistake about what the law meant. See id. at 304, 650 A.2d 348. We held that “the State need prove only that the police lawfully stopped the car, not that it could convict the driver of the motor-vehicle offense.” Ibid. At its core, Williamson involved a factual dispute: whether the officer could have an objectively reasonable belief, even if mistaken, that the defendant’s driving behavior “affected traffic,” to justify the stop. See also State v. Locurto, 157 N.J. 463, 470, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (noting that State is not required to prove that motor vehicle violation occurred in order to meet standard of reasonable suspicion).\nThus, at the time of the Appellate Division’s decision here, neither this Court nor the Appellate Division had authorized reliance on a reasonable but mistaken understanding of the law to support a search or arrest. In the appellate judgment under review, the panel relied on, as persuasive, the intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court in Heien to support its holding. We turn therefore to that decision in setting forth the background to this appeal.\nB.\nIn Heien, the United States Supreme Court considered a police officer’s reasonable but erroneous interpretation of a motor vehicle statute. In that case, a North Carolina Sheriffs Officer observed a vehicle traveling along the highway with a malfunctioning brake light. Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 534. Believing the faulty brake light to be in violation of the state’s motor vehicle code, the officer executed a traffic stop. Ibid. During the stop, the officer received permission to search the vehicle and discovered illegal drugs in a duffel bag. Ibid.\nThe defendant sought to suppress the evidence uncovered during the search, contending that the stop had violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 535. The trial court denied the suppression motion, but the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the initial stop was invalid “because driving with only one working brake light was not actually a violation of North Carolina law.” Ibid. The State appealed, and the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officer’s interpretation of the motor vehicle code—even if incorrect—was not unreasonable and thus not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Ibid.\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari. Chief Justice Roberts’s majority opinion noted that “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’” Id. at 536 (quoting Riley v. California, 573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2482, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014)). After explaining that “[t]o be reasonable is not to be perfect,” and that the Fourth Amendment allows for reasonable mistakes of fact, the Chief Justice went on to explain that the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry applies to mistakes of law just as it applies to mistakes of fact:\n[Reasonable men make mistakes of law, too, and such mistakes are no less compatible with the concept of reasonable suspicion [than mistakes of fact]. Reasonable suspicion arises from the combination of an officer’s understanding of the facts and his understanding of the relevant law. The officer may be reasonably mistaken on either ground. Whether the facts turn out to be not what was thought, or the law turns out to be not what was thought, the result is the same: the facts are outside the scope of the law. There is no reason, under the text of the Fourth Amendment or our precedents, why this same result should be acceptable when reached by way of a reasonable mistake of fact, but not when reached by way of a similarly reasonable mistake of law.\n[Ibid.l\nBased on the language of the North Carolina statute involved in Heien, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the officer’s error of law was reasonable and thus provided the officer with reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop. Id. at 540. Importantly, Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Ginsburg, wrote a concurrence that has garnered support with states that have chosen to follow the Heien approach in their own search and seizure analyses.\nJustice Kagan’s concurrence contained several important caveats, Critical to her agreement with the majority was her belief that erroneous interpretations of the law will pass Fourth Amendment scrutiny only when the law at issue is “ ‘so doubtful in construction’ that a reasonable judge could agree with the officer’s view.” Id. at 541 (Kagan, J., concurring) (quoting The Friendship, 9 F. Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125) (C.C.D. Mass. 1812)). Thus, “[i]f the statute is genuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the officer’s judgment requires hard interpretive work, then the officer has made a reasonable mistake. But if not, not.” Ibid. Such cases must necessarily involve a “really difficult” or “very hard question of statutory interpretation” and will thus be “exceedingly rare.” Ibid.\nA number of states have subsequently adopted Helen’s holding. See, e.g., Sevilla-Carcamo v. State, 335 Ga.App. 788, 783 S.E.2d 150, 153 n.12 (2016) (dicta); Williams v. State, 28 N.E.3d 293, 294-95 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015); People v. Guthrie, 25 N.Y.3d 130, 30 N.E.3d 880, 886-88 (2015); State v. Hirschkorn, 881 N.W.2d 244, 248-49 (N.D. 2016); State v. Lerma, 884 N.W.2d 749, 750-53 (S.D. 2016). However, some of those states had already developed a jurisprudence prior to Heien allowing for reasonable mistakes of law on the part of police officers. See, e.g., Sevilla-Carcamo, 783 S.E.2d at 153 n.12 (noting that Heien is in accord with established Georgia case law); State v. Wright, 791 N.W.2d 791, 796-99 (S.D. 2010) (suggesting that objectively reasonable mistake of law can provide basis for constitutional traffic stop).\nImportantly, however, a number of states have either followed or acknowledged Justice Kagan’s narrow interpretation of an objectively reasonable mistake of law when deciding similar issues under the rubric of Helen’s analysis. See State v. Stoll, 239 Ariz. 292, 370 P.3d 1130, 1134 (App. 2016) (citing Justice Kagan’s concurrence for proposition that statute must be “genuinely ambiguous” and require “hard interpretive work” to find that officer has made reasonable mistake); People v. Gaytan, 392 Ill.Dec. 333, 32 N.E.3d 641, 652 (2015) (same); State v. Eldridge, 790 S.E.2d 740, 743-44 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016) (same); State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433, 441 (2015) (noting Justice Kagan’s indication that “the bar is high in cases in which a stop is predicated on a mistake of law”); State v. Houghton, 364 Wis.2d 234, 868 N.W.2d 143, 158-60 (2015) (noting Justice Kagan’s view that objectively reasonable mistakes of law will be “exceedingly rare”); see also State v. Dopslaf, 356 P.3d 559, 563-64 (N.M. Ct. App. 2015) (citing Justice Kagan’s concurrence as support for proposition that police officer’s potential mistake of law was reasonable).\nIn this state, we have had only one prior occasion to consider Heien; that opportunity presented itself in State v. Scriven, 226 N.J. 20, 140 A.3d 535 (2016). However, we ultimately did not reach the question of whether to adopt Heien and find that an objectively reasonable mistake of law could support reasonable suspicion for a constitutional police stop. Id. at 36, 140 A.3d 535. Instead, we held that the officer’s mistake of law in that case was not objectively reasonable, see ibid., and thus did not qualify as the type of “rare” case that involves an objectively reasonable mistake of law.\nWith that background in mind, we turn to the motor vehicle statutes that, the State contends, give rise to an objectively reasonable mistake of law in this matter.\nIV.\nDefendant’s traffic stop was premised on perceived violations of two statutes.\nN.J.S.A. 39:3—61(a), relating to the types of “lamps and reflectors” required on certain motor vehicles, provides in relevant part:\nEvery motor vehicle other than a motor cycle and other than a motor-drawn vehicle shall be equipped on the front with at least two headlamps, an equal number at each side, and with two turn signals, one on each side; and on the rear with two tail lamps, two or more stop lamps, as prescribed by section 2 of L. 2013, c. 230 ([N.J.S.A.] 39:3-06.3), two turn signals, and two reflectors, one of each at each side; except that a passenger vehicle manufactured before July 2, 1964, and registered in this State may be equipped with one stop lamp, one reflector, and one tail lamp and is not required to be equipped with turn signals. [ (emphasis added).]\nN.J.S.A. 39:3-66, which specifies the proper maintenance of such lamps and reflectors, provides:\nAll lamps, reflectors and other illuminating devices required by this article shall be kept clean and in good working order and, as far as practicable, shall be mounted in such a manner as to reduce the likelihood of their being obscured by mud or dust thrown up by the wheels.\n[ (emphasis added).]\nWhen interpreting a statute we look first, and foremost, to its actual language and ascribe to its words their ordinary meaning. Mason v. City of Hoboken, 196 N.J. 51, 68, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008) (citing DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)). “If in ascribing to those words their ‘ordinary meaning and significance,’ the Legislators’ intent is self-evident, we need not search further for guidance.” Simon v. Cronecker, 189 N.J. 304, 332, 915 A.2d 489 (2007) (quoting DiProspero, 183 N.J. at 492, 874 A.2d 1039).\nThe statutes read together require that a motor vehicle only have two working rear lamps, with at least one working lamp on each side. See N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a); N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Additionally, N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 mandates that the lamps “required by this article” must be kept in good working order. Thus, if there is only the minimum one taillight on each side of a vehicle and either of those taillights is not working, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle and issue a citation for failure to maintain lamps. When a vehicle has more than the minimum of two rear taillights, for example the vehicle has two taillights on each side, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle when one side’s taillights are both out, even though the vehicle has two or more taillights illuminated on the other side. In other words, the statutes require one working taillight on each side of a vehicle. Thus, if a vehicle has two taillights on each side of the vehicle—more than the law requires—and one of those multiple taillights on one side is not working, a violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66, as was assumed and charged here, has not occurred.\nWe find the language unambiguous and therefore need not resort to legislative history. Were that history to be examined on the relevant question, we would note, as the State points out, that the Legislature did at one point begin consideration of an amendment; that amendment would have worked a different interpretation of existing law as we read it, and as it was applied in a prior unpublished decision that received legislative attention. As originally introduced at the outset of the 2012 Legislative Session, Assembly Bill 354 would have amended N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 and N.J.S.A. 39:3-61 to establish that “an equipment violation [will be found] if any lighting device installed on a vehicle is not in working order.” Those proposed amendments were never adopted by the Legislature, as the Appellate Division noted in its opinion. Suther land, 445 N.J. Super. at 367 n.3, 138 A.3d 551. We do not ascribe much weight to legislative inaction but note merely that there has been no legislation to alter prior application of the pertinent statutes. Cf. State v. Smith, 197 N.J. 325, 335, 963 A.2d 281 (2009).\nFinally, we reject the argument that N.J.S.A. 39:3-18, which addresses visibility specifications for vehicle lights, can inject ambiguity into the clear wording of the statutes at issue here. Nor does the permissive repair provision in N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(1)—which does not have applicability in the present situation or in most modern malfunctioning-taillight circumstances—convert the interpretative question before us into one that rises to the level of difficulty envisioned as the “rare” case of an objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the law. See Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 541 (noting that such cases must necessarily involve “very hard question[s] of statutory interpretation”).\nPutting the statutes in question to rigorous analysis, we fail to find them unclear, as the State suggests. We find that the officer’s erroneous application of the functioning taillight requirement was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law. This case does not present a basis for considering the application of Heien and the Appellate Division erred in reaching that determination based on the error here. Simply put, this was not a good stop. Even Heien could not save it, were we ever to consider adopting such an approach for the truly rare case that rose to the level of an objectively reasonable mistake of law. But this was not that case. The judgment of the Appellate Division, premised on an application of Heien to the stop in this matter, is reversed.\nThat, however, does not end the matter.\nV.\nThe State also asserted community caretaking as an alternative basis to support the stop. It is a rule that allows police officers to conduct warrantless searches where necessary to “preserve life or property.” State v. Edmonds, 211 N.J. 117, 141-42, 47 A.3d 737 (2012) (summarizing community caretaking rule). The rationale for the community caretaking rule is that searches made pursuant to the rule are “divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.” Id. at 142, 47 A.3d 737 (quoting Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973)).\nThat doctrine was raised at the suppression hearing and there was testimony from the officer on the point. Although raised on appeal, the Appellate Division did not reach the argument in light of the manner in which it resolved the case. Accordingly, a remand is appropriate to allow the Appellate Division to address the unresolved argument advanced by the State.\nVI.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed. We remand the matter for further proceedings in the Appellate Division.\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES ALBIN, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, AND TIMPONE join in JUSTICE LaVECCHIA’s opinion.\nThe Appellate Division opinion treats defendant as having filed two separate motions: a motion to suppress the stop and a motion to dismiss the indictment. However, it appears from the record that defendant filed one motion to dismiss the indictment for two discrete reasons: (1) because the charge resulted from an unconstitutional stop; and (2) because the prosecutor gave improper instructions to the grand jury.\nThe panel below also disagreed with the holding in the unpublished decision referenced by the trial court, which, the panel noted, is unpublished and thus does not constitute precedential authority. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 365, 138 A.3d 551.\nSome states have changed their views entirely in light of Heien. Compare Williams, 28 N.E.3d at 293-95 (Indiana Court of Appeals reversing on rehearing and following Heien's holding that reasonable mistakes of law can provide reasonable suspicion for traffic stop), with Gunn v. State, 956 N.E.2d 136, 141 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011) (noting party's acknowledgement of “Indiana decisions determining that an officer's mistake of law can never be reasonable’’); see also Guthrie, 30 N.E.3d at 885 (noting prior appellate precedent in New York that \"mistake of law cannot justify a traffic stop”).",

                            "text": "JUSTICE LaVECCHIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis Court has acknowledged that a reasonable mistake of fact on the part of a police officer will not render a search or arrest predicated on that mistake unconstitutional. See State v. Handy, 206 N.J. 39, 53-54, 18 A.3d 179 (2011). In this matter, a police officer pulled over a car under the belief that the vehicle was in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66 because one of the vehicle's taillights was not operational. The trial court determined that the officer was mistaken about the law and granted defendant's motion to suppress the fruits of the motor vehicle stop. The Appellate Division reversed. The panel determined that the relevant motor vehicle statutes were ambiguous and that, applying the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 530, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014), the officer's stop of defendant's car constituted at most an objectively reasonable mistake of law that should be treated in the same manner as a mistake of fact. Accordingly, the panel held that the officer's mistake of law did not require suppression of the motor vehicle stop.\nWe now reverse. The Appellate Division erred in concluding that the holding in Heien is applicable here. Because the motor vehicle statutes pertinent here are not ambiguous, we need not consider importing Heien into the determination of this matter. Thus, we do not address the arguments raised herein that Heien's mistake-of-law analysis is not reconcilable with our state constitutional jurisprudence. The officer's stop of defendant's motor vehicle was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law that gave rise to constitutional reasonable suspicion; the stop was therefore unconstitutional. We remand to the Appellate Division for its consideration of the State's alternative argument, which the panel did not reach, that the stop should be sustained based on the community caretaking doctrine.\nI.\nA.\nAt the suppression hearing in this matter, the following facts were adduced. Officer Michael Carletta of the Mount Olive Police Department was the sole witness.\nAt about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of February 3, 2014, Officer Carletta was on motor vehicle patrol traveling southbound on Route 206. A Toyota Camry passed him traveling northbound. Looking in his rearview mirror, the officer observed that the northbound vehicle appeared to have a malfunctioning taillight. Although the vehicle had four taillights in total, two on each side, and although only one light on the rear passenger side was not illuminated, Officer Carletta believed that the vehicle was in violation of the motor vehicle code. He made a U-turn and began to follow the vehicle. After confirming that one of the vehicle's taillights was not illuminated, he executed a motor vehicle stop.\nOfficer Carletta testified that, in such situations, it is typical police practice to give the driver a warning rather than a summons.\nAfter stopping and approaching the vehicle, Officer Carletta asked the driver, defendant Ryan Sutherland, for his driver's license, motor vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Defendant initially stated that he did not have his driver's license with him but then quickly admitted that he did not have a valid driver's license. After obtaining defendant's name and date of birth, Officer Carletta returned to his vehicle to check defendant's information with police dispatch.\nUpon confirming that defendant's license was in fact suspended, Officer Carletta issued defendant two summonses: driving with a suspended license in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-40, and failure to maintain the vehicle's \"lamps\" in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Officer Carletta explained to defendant that he had been stopped because one of his taillights was not working and that he could no longer drive the vehicle because he had a suspended driver's license. The officer allowed defendant to leave the scene on the condition that his passenger drive the car to its intended destination.\nB.\nOn June 2, 2014, defendant was charged in municipal court with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26. A Morris County grand jury later indicted defendant and charged him with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension for a second or subsequent driving-while-intoxicated conviction in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).\nDefendant filed a motion to suppress the traffic stop and to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the traffic stop constituted an unreasonable seizure because his vehicle had three operable taillights, in compliance with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66. The State countered that the stop was lawful because the malfunctioning taillight provided Officer Carletta with reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle and because the stop was lawful under the \"community caretaking\" function by which police officers engage in protecting public safety. Officer Carletta testified at the hearing that he had stopped the vehicle both because he believed that any malfunctioning taillight constituted a violation of the statute and because he was engaging in community caretaking by letting defendant know that his vehicle was not in proper working order.\nThe trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence resulting from the motor vehicle stop, but the court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of faulty instructions provided to the grand jury. On the motor vehicle stop, the trial court agreed with defendant that Officer Carletta's understanding of the maintenance-of-lamps statute had been \"incorrect\" and that defendant had not violated the statute because he had at least one functioning taillight on each side of the vehicle. Relying heavily on State v. Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. 378, 878 A.2d 857 (App. Div. 2005), as well as an unpublished 2009 Appellate Division decision, the trial court concluded that Officer Carletta's erroneous interpretation of the law-even though it was a \"common sense\" and \"practical\" approach to interpreting the statute-could not pass constitutional scrutiny.\nThe State sought leave to appeal on the grounds that (1) Officer Carletta had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop; (2) Puzio's continuing vitality was put into question by the United States Supreme Court's decision in Heien, in which the Supreme Court held that objectively reasonable mistakes of law can provide the reasonable suspicion necessary for a constitutional stop; and (3) the stop was lawful under the community caretaking doctrine. The Appellate Division granted leave to appeal and reversed the trial court in a published opinion. State v. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. 358, 138 A.3d 551 (2016).\nRelying extensively on Heien, the panel determined that \"even if the officer was mistaken that the inoperable tail light constituted a Title 39 violation, he had an objectively reasonable basis for stopping defendant's vehicle.\" Id. at 360, 138 A.3d 551. In reaching that conclusion, the panel questioned the continuing vitality of Puzio, which had held \"that where an officer mistakenly believes that driving conduct constitutes a violation of the law, but in actuality it does not, no objectively reasonable basis exists upon which to justify a vehicle stop.\" Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 383, 878 A.2d 857 (collecting cases). The panel reasoned that Puzio had been decided before Heien and that Heien's\"well-reasoned\" holding had cast doubt on Puzio's continuing validity. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 366-67, 138 A.3d 551. The panel went on to conclude that the statute at issue here was ambiguous and that even if Officer Carletta's interpretation of the statute was an objectively reasonable mistake of law, the stop was permissible pursuant to Heien\"[b]ecause the Fourth Amendment tolerates objectively reasonable mistakes of law.\" Id. at 368-70, 138 A.3d 551. The panel's reasoning made it unnecessary to reach the State's argument about the applicability of the community caretaking doctrine. Id. at 371, 138 A.3d 551.\nDefendant sought leave to appeal from this Court, which we granted. 228 N.J. 246, 156 A.3d 167 (2016). We also granted the motion of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) to appear as amicus curiae.\nII.\nThe parties' arguments are largely those advanced in the proceedings before the trial and appellate courts.\nDefendant argues that the Appellate Division's adoption of Heien is at odds with prior New Jersey precedent, which has traditionally provided greater protections under our state analogue to the Fourth Amendment than those provided by the Federal Constitution. Specifically, he argues that Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 383, 878 A.2d 857, correctly held that a traffic stop based on an incorrect interpretation of law can never be objectively reasonable. That holding, defendant argues, is a natural extension of this Court's decision in State v. Novembrino, 105 N.J. 95, 519 A.2d 820 (1987), which held that our State Constitution does not contemplate good faith mistakes by law enforcement as an exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant also contends that the statutory provisions at issue here were plain and unambiguous and did not apply to his vehicle, undermining any basis for reasonable suspicion. In essence, defendant's argument challenges Officer Carletta's interpretation of those provisions as not reasonable.\nThe State argues that the Appellate Division correctly held that Officer Carletta's belief that defendant was in violation of the motor vehicle code was objectively reasonable and provided him with reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. Relying on Heien, the State posits that just as we have held that reasonable mistakes of fact can pass constitutional scrutiny, so too should we hold that reasonable mistakes of law do not run afoul of our constitution. Such a result is not inconsistent with Puzio, the State argues, because Puzio involved an objectively unreasonable mistake of law, whereas here, Officer Carletta was forced to interpret a confusing and outdated set of statutes ambiguous enough to be open to differing and equally reasonable interpretations. Additionally, the State maintains that that it preserved its argument that Officer Carletta had lawful authority to stop defendant's vehicle based on the community caretaking doctrine, which provides police with the power to ensure the safety and welfare of the public independent of their law enforcement objectives.\nAmicus curiae ACLU-NJ argues that the statutes at issue here are not ambiguous and that the rule of lenity requires strict construction of those statutes in defendant's favor. ACLU-NJ further argues that a stop based on a police officer's misunderstanding or ignorance of the law can and should be differentiated from mistakes of fact, and that such ignorance or misunderstanding of the law must always be unreasonable and thus unconstitutional under our Article I, Paragraph 7 jurisprudence. Like defendant, ACLU-NJ maintains that that conclusion flows naturally from state constitutional case law, most specifically from Novembrino. Heien, the ACLU-NJ argues, is inconsistent with that jurisprudence and thus should not be adopted by this Court.\nIII.\nA.\nUnder previous case law in this state, a police officer's objectively reasonable mistake of fact does not render a search or arrest unconstitutional. Consistent with federal jurisprudence, we have held that Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution provides \"room ... for some mistakes [by police].\" Handy, 206 N.J. at 54, 18 A.3d 179 (second alteration in original) (quoting Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 186, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) ). However, that principle applies only when \"the police ... behave[ ] reasonably.\" Ibid.; see also State v. Green, 318 N.J. Super. 346, 352-53, 723 A.2d 1012 (App. Div. 1999) (holding reasonable but mistaken belief leading to arrest did not warrant suppression).\nIn Handy, a police dispatcher, erroneously relying on a record of a warrant containing a name and date of birth that did not match the defendant's reported information, advised a police officer to execute that warrant without taking necessary steps to clarify discrepancies. 206 N.J. at 41-42, 18 A.3d 179. Our Court concluded that the dispatcher's conduct was not objectively reasonable. Id. at 54, 18 A.3d 179. Therefore, we determined that the arrest violated the defendant's federal and state constitutional rights, and we suppressed the evidence found during the search incident to the arrest. Id. at 42, 18 A.3d 179.\nThe facts in Handy led us to a different conclusion than the mistake of fact in State v. Green, in which the error was determined to be objectively reasonable. In Green, which we cited approvingly in Handy, the Appellate Division upheld an arrest and search of defendant Green, where Green closely matched the description of another man named Lovett-for whom the warrant was issued-and where the police encountered Green outside Lovett's residence. Green, 318 N.J. Super. at 352-53, 723 A.2d 1012. In those circumstances the Appellate Division rightly concluded that the arrest was premised on an objectively reasonable mistake of fact and was thus lawful. Ibid.\nUntil the Appellate Division decision in this case, the jurisprudence of our state appellate courts had not held that reasonable mistakes of law would pass constitutional muster. In fact, courts had reached the opposite conclusion. See Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 382-83, 878 A.2d 857.\nIn Puzio, an officer stopped a moving vehicle with commercial license plates, believing the driver was operating it in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:4-46(a) because the vehicle had no placard on the right side of the vehicle displaying the name and address of its business. Id. at 380, 878 A.2d 857. The Appellate Division determined as a matter of law that the stop was in error because the statute relied on by the officer plainly excluded \"passenger vehicles,\" like the one driven by the defendant, from the \"placard\" requirement. Id. at 382-84, 878 A.2d 857.\nImportantly, the Puzio decision noted \"a clear distinction between the present situation and those presented in cases where the officer correctly understands the statute but arguably misinterprets the facts concerning whether a vehicle, or operator, has violated the statute.\" Id. at 382, 878 A.2d 857. In explaining its reasoning, the panel stated that \"[i]f officers were permitted to stop vehicles where it is objectively determined that there is no legal basis for their action, 'the potential for abuse of traffic infractions as pretext for effecting stops seems boundless and the costs to privacy rights excessive.' \" Id. at 384, 878 A.2d 857 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Valdez, 178 F.3d 282, 289 (5th Cir. 1999) ). The panel also viewed the creation of an exception for a mistake of law as inconsistent with the exclusionary rule because \"it would remove the incentive for police to make certain that they properly understand the law that they are entrusted to enforce and obey.\" Ibid. (quoting United States v. Lopez-Soto, 205 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2000) ).\nAnother mistake-of-fact case-the State's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding-is State v. Williamson, 138 N.J. 302, 650 A.2d 348 (1994). Williamson dealt with a police officer's reasonable suspicion that a motorist had \"affected traffic\" so as to be in violation of the motor vehicle code by failing to use a turn signal. Id. at 303-04, 650 A.2d 348. The officer was required to make a judgment that involved interpreting facts, namely whether the motorist had actually affected traffic; there was no mistake about what the law meant. See id. at 304, 650 A.2d 348. We held that \"the State need prove only that the police lawfully stopped the car, not that it could convict the driver of the motor-vehicle offense.\" Ibid. At its core, Williamson involved a factual dispute: whether the officer could have an objectively reasonable belief, even if mistaken, that the defendant's driving behavior \"affected traffic,\" to justify the stop. See also State v. Locurto, 157 N.J. 463, 470, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (noting that State is not required to prove that motor vehicle violation occurred in order to meet standard of reasonable suspicion).\nThus, at the time of the Appellate Division's decision here, neither this Court nor the Appellate Division had authorized reliance on a reasonable but mistaken understanding of the law to support a search or arrest. In the appellate judgment under review, the panel relied on, as persuasive, the intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court in Heien to support its holding. We turn therefore to that decision in setting forth the background to this appeal.\nB.\nIn Heien, the United States Supreme Court considered a police officer's reasonable but erroneous interpretation of a motor vehicle statute. In that case, a North Carolina Sheriff's Officer observed a vehicle traveling along the highway with a malfunctioning brake light. Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 534. Believing the faulty brake light to be in violation of the state's motor vehicle code, the officer executed a traffic stop. Ibid. During the stop, the officer received permission to search the vehicle and discovered illegal drugs in a duffel bag. Ibid.\nThe defendant sought to suppress the evidence uncovered during the search, contending that the stop had violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 535. The trial court denied the suppression motion, but the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the initial stop was invalid \"because driving with only one working brake light was not actually a violation of North Carolina law.\" Ibid. The State appealed, and the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officer's interpretation of the motor vehicle code-even if incorrect-was not unreasonable and thus not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Ibid.\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari. Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion noted that \"the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is 'reasonableness.' \" Id. at 536 (quoting Riley v. California, 573 U.S. ----, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2482, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014) ). After explaining that \"[t]o be reasonable is not to be perfect,\" and that the Fourth Amendment allows for reasonable mistakes of fact, the Chief Justice went on to explain that the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry applies to mistakes of law just as it applies to mistakes of fact:\n[R]easonable men make mistakes of law, too, and such mistakes are no less compatible with the concept of reasonable suspicion [than mistakes of fact]. Reasonable suspicion arises from the combination of an officer's understanding of the facts and his understanding of the relevant law. The officer may be reasonably mistaken on either ground. Whether the facts turn out to be not what was thought, or the law turns out to be not what was thought, the result is the same: the facts are outside the scope of the law. There is no reason, under the text of the Fourth Amendment or our precedents, why this same result should be acceptable when reached by way of a reasonable mistake of fact, but not when reached by way of a similarly reasonable mistake of law.\n[ Ibid. ]\nBased on the language of the North Carolina statute involved in Heien, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the officer's error of law was reasonable and thus provided the officer with reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop. Id. at 540. Importantly, Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Ginsburg, wrote a concurrence that has garnered support with states that have chosen to follow the Heien approach in their own search and seizure analyses.\nJustice Kagan's concurrence contained several important caveats. Critical to her agreement with the majority was her belief that erroneous interpretations of the law will pass Fourth Amendment scrutiny only when the law at issue is \" 'so doubtful in construction' that a reasonable judge could agree with the officer's view.\" Id. at 541 (Kagan, J., concurring) (quoting The Friendship, 9 F. Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125) (C.C.D. Mass. 1812) ). Thus, \"[i]f the statute is genuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the officer's judgment requires hard interpretive work, then the officer has made a reasonable mistake. But if not, not.\" Ibid. Such cases must necessarily involve a \"really difficult\" or \"very hard question of statutory interpretation\" and will thus be \"exceedingly rare.\" Ibid.\nA number of states have subsequently adopted Heien's holding. See, e.g., Sevilla-Carcamo v. State, 335 Ga.App. 788, 783 S.E.2d 150, 153 n.12 (2016) (dicta); Williams v. State, 28 N.E.3d 293, 294-95 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015) ; People v. Guthrie, 25 N.Y.3d 130, 30 N.E.3d 880, 886-88 (2015) ; State v. Hirschkorn, 881 N.W.2d 244, 248-49 (N.D. 2016) ; State v. Lerma, 884 N.W.2d 749, 750-53 (S.D. 2016). However, some of those states had already developed a jurisprudence prior to Heien allowing for reasonable mistakes of law on the part of police officers. See, e.g., Sevilla-Carcamo, 783 S.E.2d at 153 n.12 (noting that Heien is in accord with established Georgia case law); State v. Wright, 791 N.W.2d 791, 796-99 (S.D. 2010) (suggesting that objectively reasonable mistake of law can provide basis for constitutional traffic stop).\nImportantly, however, a number of states have either followed or acknowledged Justice Kagan's narrow interpretation of an objectively reasonable mistake of law when deciding similar issues under the rubric of Heien's analysis. See State v. Stoll, 239 Ariz. 292, 370 P.3d 1130, 1134 (App. 2016) (citing Justice Kagan's concurrence for proposition that statute must be \"genuinely ambiguous\" and require \"hard interpretive work\" to find that officer has made reasonable mistake); People v. Gaytan, 392 Ill.Dec. 333, 32 N.E.3d 641, 652 (2015) (same); State v. Eldridge, 790 S.E.2d 740, 743-44 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016) (same); State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433, 441 (2015) (noting Justice Kagan's indication that \"the bar is high in cases in which a stop is predicated on a mistake of law\"); State v. Houghton, 364 Wis.2d 234, 868 N.W.2d 143, 158-60 (2015) (noting Justice Kagan's view that objectively reasonable mistakes of law will be \"exceedingly rare\"); see also State v. Dopslaf, 356 P.3d 559, 563-64 (N.M. Ct. App. 2015) (citing Justice Kagan's concurrence as support for proposition that police officer's potential mistake of law was reasonable).\nIn this state, we have had only one prior occasion to consider Heien; that opportunity presented itself in State v. Scriven, 226 N.J. 20, 140 A.3d 535 (2016). However, we ultimately did not reach the question of whether to adopt Heien and find that an objectively reasonable mistake of law could support reasonable suspicion for a constitutional police stop. Id. at 36, 140 A.3d 535. Instead, we held that the officer's mistake of law in that case was not objectively reasonable, see ibid., and thus did not qualify as the type of \"rare\" case that involves an objectively reasonable mistake of law.\nWith that background in mind, we turn to the motor vehicle statutes that, the State contends, give rise to an objectively reasonable mistake of law in this matter.\nIV.\nDefendant's traffic stop was premised on perceived violations of two statutes.\nN.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a), relating to the types of \"lamps and reflectors\" required on certain motor vehicles, provides in relevant part:\nEvery motor vehicle other than a motor cycle and other than a motor-drawn vehicle shall be equipped on the front with at least two headlamps, an equal number at each side, and with two turn signals, one on each side; and on the rear with two tail lamps, two or more stop lamps, as prescribed by section 2 of L. 2013, c. 230 ( [N.J.S.A.] 39:3-66.3 ), two turn signals, and two reflectors, one of each at each side; except that a passenger vehicle manufactured before July 2, 1954, and registered in this State may be equipped with one stop lamp, one reflector, and one tail lamp and is not required to be equipped with turn signals.\n[ (emphasis added).]\nN.J.S.A. 39:3-66, which specifies the proper maintenance of such lamps and reflectors, provides:\nAll lamps, reflectors and other illuminating devices required by this article shall be kept clean and in good working order and, as far as practicable, shall be mounted in such a manner as to reduce the likelihood of their being obscured by mud or dust thrown up by the wheels.\n[ (emphasis added).]\nWhen interpreting a statute we look first, and foremost, to its actual language and ascribe to its words their ordinary meaning. Mason v. City of Hoboken, 196 N.J. 51, 68, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008) (citing DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005) ). \"If in ascribing to those words their 'ordinary meaning and significance,' the Legislators' intent is self-evident, we need not search further for guidance.\" Simon v. Cronecker, 189 N.J. 304, 332, 915 A.2d 489 (2007) (quoting DiProspero, 183 N.J. at 492, 874 A.2d 1039 ).\nThe statutes read together require that a motor vehicle only have two working rear lamps, with at least one working lamp on each side. See N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) ; N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Additionally, N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 mandates that the lamps \"required by this article\" must be kept in good working order. Thus, if there is only the minimum one taillight on each side of a vehicle and either of those taillights is not working, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle and issue a citation for failure to maintain lamps. When a vehicle has more than the minimum of two rear taillights, for example the vehicle has two taillights on each side, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle when one side's taillights are both out, even though the vehicle has two or more taillights illuminated on the other side. In other words, the statutes require one working taillight on each side of a vehicle. Thus, if a vehicle has two taillights on each side of the vehicle-more than the law requires-and one of those multiple taillights on one side is not working, a violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66, as was assumed and charged here, has not occurred.\nWe find the language unambiguous and therefore need not resort to legislative history. Were that history to be examined on the relevant question, we would note, as the State points out, that the Legislature did at one point begin consideration of an amendment; that amendment would have worked a different interpretation of existing law as we read it, and as it was applied in a prior unpublished decision that received legislative attention. As originally introduced at the outset of the 2012 Legislative Session, Assembly Bill 354 would have amended N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 and N.J.S.A. 39:3-61 to establish that \"an equipment violation [will be found] if any lighting device installed on a vehicle is not in working order.\" Those proposed amendments were never adopted by the Legislature, as the Appellate Division noted in its opinion.\nSutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 367 n.3, 138 A.3d 551. We do not ascribe much weight to legislative inaction but note merely that there has been no legislation to alter prior application of the pertinent statutes. Cf. State v. Smith, 197 N.J. 325, 335, 963 A.2d 281 (2009).\nFinally, we reject the argument that N.J.S.A. 39:3-48, which addresses visibility specifications for vehicle lights, can inject ambiguity into the clear wording of the statutes at issue here. Nor does the permissive repair provision in N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(l ) -which does not have applicability in the present situation or in most modern malfunctioning-taillight circumstances-convert the interpretative question before us into one that rises to the level of difficulty envisioned as the \"rare\" case of an objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the law. See Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 541 (noting that such cases must necessarily involve \"very hard question[s] of statutory interpretation\").\nPutting the statutes in question to rigorous analysis, we fail to find them unclear, as the State suggests. We find that the officer's erroneous application of the functioning taillight requirement was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law. This case does not present a basis for considering the application of Heien and the Appellate Division erred in reaching that determination based on the error here. Simply put, this was not a good stop. Even Heien could not save it, were we ever to consider adopting such an approach for the truly rare case that rose to the level of an objectively reasonable mistake of law. But this was not that case. The judgment of the Appellate Division, premised on an application of Heien to the stop in this matter, is reversed.\nThat, however, does not end the matter.\nV.\nThe State also asserted community caretaking as an alternative basis to support the stop. It is a rule that allows police officers to conduct warrantless searches where necessary to \"preserve life or property.\" State v. Edmonds, 211 N.J. 117, 141-42, 47 A.3d 737 (2012) (summarizing community caretaking rule). The rationale for the community caretaking rule is that searches made pursuant to the rule are \"divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\" Id. at 142, 47 A.3d 737 (quoting Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973) ).\nThat doctrine was raised at the suppression hearing and there was testimony from the officer on the point. Although raised on appeal, the Appellate Division did not reach the argument in light of the manner in which it resolved the case. Accordingly, a remand is appropriate to allow the Appellate Division to address the unresolved argument advanced by the State.\nVI.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed. We remand the matter for further proceedings in the Appellate Division.\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES ALBIN, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, AND TIMPONE join in JUSTICE LaVECCHIA's opinion.\nThe Appellate Division opinion treats defendant as having filed two separate motions: a motion to suppress the stop and a motion to dismiss the indictment. However, it appears from the record that defendant filed one motion to dismiss the indictment for two discrete reasons: (1) because the charge resulted from an unconstitutional stop; and (2) because the prosecutor gave improper instructions to the grand jury.\nThe panel below also disagreed with the holding in the unpublished decision referenced by the trial court, which, the panel noted, is unpublished and thus does not constitute precedential authority. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 365, 138 A.3d 551.\nSome states have changed their views entirely in light of Heien. Compare Williams, 28 N.E.3d at 293-95 (Indiana Court of Appeals reversing on rehearing and following Heien's holding that reasonable mistakes of law can provide reasonable suspicion for traffic stop), with Gunn v. State, 956 N.E.2d 136, 141 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011) (noting party's acknowledgement of \"Indiana decisions determining that an officer's mistake of law can never be reasonable\"); see also Guthrie, 30 N.E.3d at 885 (noting prior appellate precedent in New York that \"mistake of law cannot justify a traffic stop\").",

                            "text": "Chief Justice RABNER\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis case involves people who have incurred debts, have no assets to repay them, and want to discharge those debts in bankruptcy court. In the years since the recent downturn in the economy, tens of thousands of New Jersey residents have found themselves in that situation. Because they do not have enough money to pay for a lawyer, too many people have been forced to represent themselves as they navigate the technical field of bankruptcy law.\nIn response, Volunteer Lawyers for Justice (VLJ), a legal services organization, created a bankruptcy clinic to assist low-income debtors who have no assets to distribute. VLJ and the volunteer lawyers who work with the group screen potential clients in an effort to avoid conflicts of interest.\nA number of volunteer attorneys work at a law firm that also represents large, institutional creditors in unrelated matters. VLJ represents that other potential volunteers are reluctant to participate in the clinic because of possible ethical objections.\nVLJ therefore turned to the Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics (ACPE) for guidance and posed the following question: can a volunteer lawyer represent a low-income debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding if the lawyer’s firm represents one or more of the debtor’s creditors in unrelated matters? In other words, if a potential pro bono bankruptcy client owes thousands of dollars in credit card debt to a bank, and the bank is a client of the firm in an entirely different legal matter, can a lawyer at the firm volunteer to represent the debtor in bankruptcy court?\nThe ACPE concluded that both clients must be informed and “decide whether they consent to waive the conflict.” Particularly in light of the nature of Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, and the standards that govern the clinic and pro bono counsel, we do not agree. We do not believe that participation in the program poses a conflict of interest under the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC). See RPC 1.7(a)(2). As a result, we conclude that this valuable pro bono effort can continue to operate with appropriate safeguards.\nI.\nA.\nVLJ provides free legal services to low-income residents of New Jersey on a wide range of civil issues. Since the start of the recent recession, a growing number of people have sought help to discharge debts they cannot pay. To address part of the problem, VLJ and Merck, a pharmaceutical company with an in-house legal staff, established a volunteer bankruptcy clinic in 2009 to assist low-income people prepare and file bankruptcy petitions and to represent them at hearings. The clinic serves indigent clients in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, and Union Counties.\nIn 2010, VLJ and Merck enlisted the help of lawyers in the bankruptcy department at Lowenstein Sandler, a large New Jersey law firm. The firm also represents institutional creditors in matters unrelated to VLJ’s cases.\nTo screen for potential conflicts, VLJ and the firm implemented various safeguards, following the lead of ethics committees in New York City and Boston. Both committees had approved similar pro bono bankruptcy programs that are discussed below.\nThe clinic operates in the following way. When a debtor considering filing for bankruptcy contacts VLJ, the group initially determines if the person qualifies for its help. The clinic only represents low-income individuals with “no assetsâ for purposes of Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases. VLJ thus examines each debtor’s finances and turns away anyone with assets available for distribution to creditors or an annual income of about $27,500 or more. VLJ sometimes refers debtors with minimal assets to other pro bono attorneys outside the clinic.\nFor debtors who qualify, VLJ collects the documents needed to file a Chapter 7 petition, including a list of outstanding debts; gathers the names of attorneys or collection agencies that creditors may have hired; and sends the information to a volunteer attorney. Both attorneys and paralegals at VLJ conduct the initial screening.\nOnce volunteer attorneys at the firm receive the information, they conduct a conflict check on each relevant person or entity in the client file before contacting the debtor. Potential conflicts involving other matters handled by the firm are identified in that way. The firm, like VLJ, also confirms that the debtor has no assets available for distribution.\nAttorneys decline to take the case if the conflict check reveals that the firm represents or has represented one of the debtor’s creditors in a matter related to the debtor. If a creditor the firm represents has brought a lawsuit or collection action against the debtor in an unrelated matter, the attorneys also decline the debtorâs case. Otherwise, the attorneys generally accept the representation, even if the firm represents one or more of the debtor’s creditors in unrelated matters.\nWhen volunteer attorneys meet with debtors, they confirm the above conditions. Consistent with the recommendations of ethics panels in New York City and Boston, the attorneys also ask whether\nthe case involves only one creditor; the client has granted any new liens or made any non-routine payments in the past ninety days; any of the debts to be discharged is of a sufficient size that it is likely to have a material impact on the creditor’s bottom line; other facts suggest an unusual or disproportionate impact on any particular creditor; and other forms of bankruptcy relief or alternatives to bankruptcy warrant consideration.\nAnswers to those questions may identify additional conflicts.\nAfter the conflict check is completed, the firm prepares an engagement letter for the debtor to sign. The letter informs the debtor that the firm will withdraw from representation if a conflict of interest arises, including if a creditor the firm represents objects to the bankruptcy petition or starts an adversary proceeding against the debtor.\nThe letter also informs the debtor of the scope of the firm’s representation. Among other things, the firm will prepare and file the debtor’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and represent the debtor at a meeting of the creditors under the Bankruptcy Code, sometimes referred to as a “section 341 meeting.” That meeting takes place before any debts may be discharged and gives creditors an opportunity to question the debtor under oath. VLJ represents that no creditors have appeared at the section 341 meetings of any pro bono clients.\nAs of December 2012, more than fifty volunteer attorneys had represented approximately one hundred pro bono clients through the clinic. VLJ had approached additional lawyers at other firms to recruit them as volunteers. It represents that those attorneys were hesitant to participate in the clinic because they represent creditors in unrelated matters and were concerned about possible conflicts of interest issues.\nB.\nTo clarify the issue, VLJ sent a formal inquiry to the ACPE on December 2, 2012. The ACPE is a committee of the Supreme Court that addresses questions about the “proper conduct” of lawyers under the RPCs. R. 1:19-2. VLJ asked the Committee “whether a volunteer pro bono attorney may represent low-income debtors in seeking relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code even if the attorney’s firm represents creditors of those debtors in unrelated matters.”\nThe ACPE responded in the form of a written opinion dated May 10, 2013. It concluded that “lawyers need to inform creditor clients of their participation in the program and obtain consent” before they can represent a debtor who âhas obligations to the creditor client.”\nThe ACPE recognized that a lawyer’s representation of a debtor in a “no-assetâ Chapter 7 bankruptcy case did not create a direct conflict of interest with a creditor. See RPC 1.7(a)(1). The ACPE’s opinion letter focused on RPC 1.7(a)(2) instead, which provides that a conflict of interest exists when “there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client.”\nThe Committee observed that although these cases presumably involve small amounts of money, a creditor may object based on “loyalty concerns or other non-monetary interests.” According to the ACPE, therefore, the lawyer “could be materially limited by obligations to the creditor client and a conflict would arise.” The Committee could not “find, as a categorical matter, that in all cases there would be no material limitation on the lawyer’s representation.” It noted that “an unreasonable client may have inflated expectations of loyalty”; “that not all clients would be content if their lawyer represents debtors in such proceedings”; and that even if adverse interests are indirect, “there is a risk that the representation will be materially limited.” It thus directed volunteer lawyers to inform both clients “of their participation in the program and obtain consent.”\nWe granted VLJ’s petition for review of the ACPE’s final action under Rule 1:19-8. 216 N.J. 12, 76 A.3d 531 (2013). We also granted motions from the Now Jersey State Bar Association as well as the Pro Bono Institute, along with two individuals who direct public interest programs at Rutgers School of Law-Newark and -Camden, to appear as amici curiae.\nII.\nVLJ argues that the ACPE misapplied RPC 1.7(a)(2). The group contends that the ACPE erred in finding a conflict under the rule because there is no “significant risk” that an attorney’s pro bono representation of a low-income Chapter 7 debtor will “materially limit” his or her representation of one of the debtor’s creditors in an unrelated matter. According to VLJ, the risk of a conflict of interest is remote. VLJ also maintains that the ACPE effectively revived the “appearance of impropriety” standard and failed to take account of the safeguards in the clinic’s screening measures and conflicts checks. VLJ points to other ethics opinions in New York City and Boston that have approved nearly identical programs. In addition, VLJ argues that attorneys serve an important public interest when they provide specialized legal services to low-income debtors on a pro bono basis.\nThe Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the ACPE, argues that the Committee’s opinion is correct. The Attorney General notes that the interests of a creditor and debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy may be indirectly adverse and that, in some instances, there may be a significant risk that the lawyer’s representation will be materially limited. In addition, the Attorney General suggests that opinions from jurisdictions that require consent from both clients in comparable bankruptcy matters should be given more weight than rulings by ethics committees in New York City and Boston.\nThe New Jersey State Bar Association (NJSBA) argues that the standard the ACPE articulated is inconsistent with the plain meaning of RPC 1.7(a)(2). The NJSBA also contends that the ACPE failed to consider relevant bankruptcy rules that permit court-appointed trustees to hire lawyers who may represent creditors in unrelated matters. The NJSBA presents other arguments that echo VLJ’s position. Among other points, the NJSBA stresses that the ACPE’s opinion will have a negative effect on pro bono efforts that are needed to help low-income residents in New Jersey.\nThe Pro Bono Institute, a non-profit organization that provides research and assistance to legal groups seeking to help the poor and others, and two individuals who oversee public interest programs at Eutgers School of Law-Newark and -Camden, presented a combined brief as amici. They document the need for pro bono representation, nationally and in New Jersey, and the recent increase in pro se Chapter 7 filings. Like VLJ and the NJSBA, amici argue that this lack of representation creates a gap in the administration of justice, which pro bono programs can help close.\nIII.\nWe briefly review certain features of federal bankruptcy law to provide context for this matter.\n“The principal purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to grant a ‘fresh start’ to the ‘honest but unfortunate debtor.’ ” Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U.S. 365, 367, 127 S.Ct. 1105, 1107, 166 L.Ed. 2d 956, 961-62 (2007) (citation omitted). Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code provides a straightforward framework (a) to discharge an individual debtor’s unpaid debts, to the extent the law allows, and (b) to distribute any non-exempt assets among creditors in an equitable way. Collier on Bankruptcy U 1.07| l][a][i] (Alan N. Eesnick & Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed.). Chapter 7 outlines a mechanism to take control of a debtor’s property, sell it, and distribute the proceeds to creditors. Id. at II 1.07[l][a]. But many Chapter 7 cases—like the ones VLJ handles—are “no-asset” cases in which the debtor has no property to distribute and the creditor may receive nothing. Id. at II 1.07[ll[a][l], -[l][n.\nIn a typical Chapter 7 case, “the debtor files a petition for bankruptcy in which he lists his debts or his creditors; [and] the petition constitutes an order for relief.” Tenn. Student Assistance Corp. v. Hood, 541 U.S. 440, 447, 124 S.Ct. 1905, 1910, 158 L.Ed.2d 764, 775 (2004) (citations omitted). The court clerk, in turn, “notifies the debtor’s creditors of the order.” Ibid.\nWithin a reasonable amount of time, a trustee then convenes and presides over a “meeting of creditors,” in accordance with section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C.A. § 341(a). The debtor must attend the section 341 meeting and “submit to examinationâ under oath by any creditors that choose to attend. Collier, supra, H 1.07[l][c]. The meeting is not a formal judicial proceeding; it is not conducted in court, and the bankruptcy judge may not attend. See 11 U.S.C.A § 341(c).\nA creditor can file a complaint and object to the discharge of debt. See Daniel R. Cowans, Bankruptcy Law & Practice § 5.5 at 68-70 (7th ed.1998). The grounds for objection, though, are limited by statute. See 11 U.S.C.A § 727(a) (listing, among other grounds, when debtor has transferred, destroyed, or concealed property with intent to defraud, or has knowingly made false oath in bankruptcy case). In most cases, creditors do not object, see Cowans, supra, § 5.3 at 62; it “can be expensive” to do so, and “not overly productive” to collect from a debtor whose discharge is denied, id. at § 5.4 at 65.\nUnless a debtor has committed a prohibited act listed in section 727, the discharge of debt is not discretionary. Rather, “the debtor is entitled to a fall discharge and release from all [dis-chargeable] debts.” Collier, supra, 111.07[l][a][i] (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see also 11 U.S.C.A § 727(a) (providing that “court shall grant the debtor a discharge,” absent listed circumstances (emphasis added)).\nMost Chapter 7 cases, as a result, are straightforward and non-adversarial. The structured proceedings, guided by federal law, can be resolved quickly and without disputes. See Berliner v. Pappalardo (In re Puffer), 674 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir.2012). As one bankruptcy judge observed in the context of reviewing a fee application, “the services required in a Chapter 7 case, i.e., the filing of papers and attendance at a § 341 meeting for about five minutes, are, like those performed in an uncontested divorce, among the simplest of non-adversarial legal problems which any lawyer will encounter.” In re Patronek, 121 B.R. 728, 734 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1990).\nMost debtors seek bankruptcy relief under Chapter 7. Collier, supra, If 1.07[1]. In New Jersey, about seventy-five percent of all bankruptcy filings are submitted by individuals under Chapter 7. See Admin. Office of the U.S. Cts., U.S. Bankr.Cts.—Bus. and Nonbusiness Cases Commenced, by Ch. of the Bankr. Code During the 12-Month Period Ending Mar. SI, 201k, Table F-2, www. uscourts.gov/uscourts/statistics/bankruptcystatistics/bankruptcy filmgs/2014/0314_i2.pdf (last visited June 5, 2014).\nA far smaller number of debtors proceed under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, ibid., which provides for a very different approach. Under Chapter 13, debtors with a regular income can hold onto their assets and pay off their debt to creditors over time. Collier, supra, If 1.07[5][e]. Debts are only discharged once a repayment plan has been completed. Id. at 111.07[5][e]. Thus, although Chapter 7 and 13 proceedings have similar aims, they “are poles apart in the means employed” to achieve them. Id. at If 1300.02.\nIV.\nWe consider the question presented—whether volunteer lawyers who represent low-income persons in “no asset” Chapter 7 bankruptcy matters have a conflict if their firm represents a creditor in an unrelated matter—in light of RPC 1.7. Because the Court has plenary authority to regulate the legal profession in New Jersey, we review this issue de novo. See N.J. Const. art. VI, § 2, If 3; In re Sup. Ct. Adv. Comm. on Prof'l Ethics Op. No. 697, 188 N.J. 549, 554, 911 A.2d 51 (2006); In re LiVolsi, 85 N.J. 576, 585, 428 A.2d 1268 (1981).\nRPC 1.7 provides as follows:\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:\n(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or\n(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client, a farmer client, or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.\n(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:\n(1) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing, after full disclosure and consultation____\nThe parties do not suggest that representation of a low-income debtor is “directly adverse” to a creditor that the firm represents in an unrelated matter. Our focus, therefore, is on section (a)(2). That clause outlines the proper framework for analysis: a conflict exists if there is a “significant risk” that a volunteer lawyer’s representation of an indigent client in a Chapter 7 proceeding “will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities” to a creditor the firm represents in an unrelated matter, or vice versa. RPC 1.7(a)(2).\nThe Court adopted the ABA (American Bar Association) Model Rules of Professional Conduct in 1984 “to harmonize New Jerseyâs standards with the Model Rules and to provide clear, enforceable standards of behavior for lawyers.” State v. Rue, 175 N.J. 1, 14, 811 A.2d 425 (2002). The official ABA comments to the RPCs can assist in interpreting them. Introduction to Rules of Professional Conduct, Kevin H. Michels, New Jersey Attorney Ethics, Appendix A2 at 1257 (2014).\nComment 8 to the relevant model rule addresses what constitutes a significant risk of a material limitation. See Model Rules ofProfl Conduct R. 1.7 cmt. 8 (2018). The comment explains that the âmere possibility of subsequent harm does not itself require disclosure and consent.” Ibid. Instead, there must be “a significant risk that a lawyer’s ability to consider, recommend or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client will be materially limited as a result of the lawyer’s other responsibilities or interests.” Ibid. To identify such a risk, “[t]he critical questions are the likelihood that a difference in interests” will arise, and “if it does, whether it will materially interfere with the lawyer’s independent professional judgment in considering alternatives or fore close courses of action that reasonably should be pursued on behalf of the client.” Ibid. For example, an attorney “asked to represent several people seeking to form a joint venture is likely to be materially limited in the lawyer’s ability to recommend or advocate all possible positions that each might take because of the lawyer’s duty of loyalty to the others.â Ibid.\nLawyers are called upon to make the above determination whenever they consider representing a new client with a connection to another client. RPC 1.7 requires counsel to exercise professional judgment about the possibility of a concurrent conflict under the circumstances; the rule does not require attorneys to notify a client and get consent unless there is a significant risk that one client’s interests will materially limit the lawyer’s obligations to the other.\nV.\nAdvisory committees in other states have considered comparable programs, and two of them have approved pro bono Chapter 7 bankruptcy initiatives similar to the clinic’s efforts.\nIn New York City, the Bar Association’s Committee on Professional and Judicial Ethics considered a nearly identical pro bono program. See The Ass’n of the Bar of the City of N.Y. Comm, on Profl and Judicial Ethics, Formal Op. 2005-01, 1 (2005). It concluded that, under certain conditions, volunteer lawyers from large commercial law firms could simultaneously represent both low-income debtors in Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, and their creditors in unrelated matters, without giving rise to a conflict of interest. Id. at 1, 8.\nThe opinion observed that Chapter 7 proceedings are “[ujnlike the commencement of litigation—which by definition is brought directly against one or more parties on behalf of another party with an adverse interest.” Id. at 5. “[A] typical Chapter 7 case,” by contrast, “is an in rem proceeding that triggers the automatic operation of a statutory framework for marshaling and distributing assets and discharging debt.” Ibid. Absent an objection, debts are discharged “by automatic operation of statute.” Ibid. The committee noted that “there is no adversity between debtor and creditor” under the relevant ethical rules “unless and until a creditor objects.” Id. at 6. It also considered “adversity of an indirect nature.” Ibid.\nThe committee explained that its analysis might be different under other circumstances: if the prospective client were involved in litigation or a dispute with a client of the firm; if the firm represented institutional clients in consumer collection actions; if the debtor âhad no non-exempt assets and only a single creditor” that the firm represented, in which case the filing of a Chapter 7 petition could appear to be “more directly aimed at that particular creditor”; if the debtor “had granted new liens ... or made nonroutine payments within the past 90 days”; or if the “client’s personal circumstances made it advisable for him or her to consider ... forms of bankruptcy relief’ other than Chapter 7. Id. at 6-7. As noted above, VLJ’s clinic seeks to avoid handling those types of eases.\nIn addition, the committee concluded that if a creditor objects to the discharge of a debt, or takes some other action against the debtor, the volunteer lawyer “cannot represent the debtorâ without getting “any necessary consent.” Id. at 8. The clinic follows that approach as well.\nThree years later, the Boston Bar Association’s Ethics Committee approved a similar pro bono bankruptcy initiative. Bos. Bar Ass’n Ethics Comm., Op. 2008-01, 1 (2008). The committee found that, “[ajbsent special circumstances, ... the proposed representation does not give rise to a conflict of interest” under a rule comparable to RPC 1.7. Id. at 10.\nLike the New York opinion, the Boston committee remarked that “in ordinary circumstances a Chapter 7 Petition is not directed ‘against’ any particular creditor. Thus [it] is not like filing a lawsuit on behalf of one creditor against another creditor” or “a debtor against a creditor.” Id. at 5. The committee also compared volunteer lawyers to attorneys appointed by a bankrupt cy trustee â “who have multiple representations involving creditors and the debtor’ ” in unrelated matters. Id. at 6-7 (quoting 1 Collier on Bankruptcy f 8.03[9][b] (Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer eds., 15th ed. rev.) (citing 11 U.S.C.A. § 327)).\nIn addition, the committee credited the initiative for taking “appropriate steps to identify and avoid any special circumstances where the lawyer’s ability to act could be materially limited.” Id. at 9-10. Under Boston’s program, volunteer lawyers are to ask questions to screen new clients for possible conflicts. Ibid. VLJ’s initiative requires this as well.\nOther ethics opinions are distinguishable or do not consider the issue in detail. The North Carolina Bar, for example, does not permit attorneys to represent a debtor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case if they represent a lender in other matters, without the consent of both clients. See N.C. State Bar, Formal Ethics Op. 11 (2010). But Chapter 13 proceedings, which seek to preserve the debtor’s assets and involve potentially lengthy repayment plans between debtors and creditors, present different concerns than Chapter 7 cases do.\nThe Oregon State Bar Association has opined that a lawyer may not simultaneously represent a debtor and creditor in the same bankruptcy proceeding. Or. State Bar Ass’n, Formal Op. No. 2005-40 (2005). It also stated that a lawyer would need consent from both clients to represent the debtor in bankruptcy court if the creditor was a client in an unrelated matter. Ibid. The opinion offers no analysis and does not identify the type of bankruptcy proceeding involved.\nFinally, New York’s Suffolk County Bar Association opined in 1991 that lawyers could not represent a debtor in an unspecified type of bankruptcy proceeding if the lawyer also represented a creditor in an unrelated case. Suffolk Cnty. Bar Ass’n, Op. 91-1 (1991). The brief opinion also contains little analysis and refers, in part, to an outdated standard: the need to avoid an appearance of impropriety. Id. at 1; see also In re Op. 697, supra, 188 N.J. at 552, 911 A.2d 51.\nVI.\nWe consider VLJ’s program in light of RPC 1.7. We conclude that the program does not present a conflict of interest under the rule for a number of reasons.\nTo begin with, the nature of Chapter 7 proceedings makes it less likely that a difference of interests between debtors and creditors will develop. Model Rules of Prof l Conduct R. 1.7, swpra, emt. 8. As discussed earlier, a Chapter 7 proceeding is not a lawsuit between a debtor and creditor. When a Chapter 7 petition is filed on behalf of a debtor, that triggers a predetermined statutory process to liquidate assets and discharge outstanding debts. See Cowans, supra, § 5.3 at 62. The process does not become adversarial unless someone—in particular a creditor—files a complaint and objects. See id.; Patronek, supra, 121 B.R. at 734. If that happens, a volunteer lawyer in the VLJ program withdraws from assisting the debtor if the lawyer’s firm also represents the creditor.\nThe safeguards built into VLJâs initiative also minimize the risk of a conflict of interest. The program screens out directly adverse interests at the outset, such as when a firm represents a creditor in a matter related to the bankruptcy, or the creditor has brought a lawsuit or collection action against the debtor in an unrelated case. Volunteer lawyers also pose questions designed to root out cases that may be of particular importance to a creditor. They screen for cases that involve only one creditor or debts that are sufficiently large that they would likely have a material impact on a creditor’s bottom line.\nIn most cases, those concerns do not surface. For large institutional creditors, like banks or cell phone service providers, the amount of debt in a typical Chapter 7 case is not significant to the company as a whole. For smaller creditors as well, it often costs more than the value of the debt to send a representative to a section 341 meeting or challenge the discharge. See Cowans, supra, § 5.4 at 65.\nAnother important part of the screening process is a thorough effort to ensure that prospective clients are truly indigent. VLJ only represents people with an income up to 175% of the federal poverty level—about $27,500 for a family of two. VLJ also screens out individuals who have assets available for distribution to creditors. Volunteer attorneys at the firm conduct the same review a second time.\nThe issue before the Court relates only to “no-asset” Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. We do not address Chapter 7 petitions in which there are assets to distribute or proceedings under any other chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. As a practical matter, in the “no-asset” cases the clinic handles, there are no non-exempt assets for a debtor to try to shield or a creditor to receive.\nThere are also two forms of notice to clients. The firm tells debtors at the outset that it will withdraw if a conflict arises, for example, in the unlikely event a creditor it represents objects to the petition. Creditors also receive notice that the law firm represents a debtor. The Bankruptcy Court sends a notice, which identifies the debtor’s lawyer, to all creditors listed on the Chapter 7 petition. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 2002(a)(1). We do not suggest that this type of notice, by itself, constitutes a waiver in this or other contexts.\nIn addition, we note that the Bankruptcy Code, in an analogous context, allows court-appointed trustees to hire “disinterested” attorneys to help carry out the trustee’s duties. 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(a). The Code expressly states that attorneys are not disqualified “solely because of [their] employment by or representation of a creditor,” unless another creditor or the trustee objects and “there is an actual conflict of interest.â 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(c). As one authoritative treatise has noted, the “Bankruptcy Code contemplates that attorneys will, in unrelated matters, have multiple representations involving creditors and the debtor.” Collier, supra, 1i 8.08[9J[b] (discussing 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(c)).\nTo be sure, some creditors who are clients of the firm may be less than pleased by a lawyer’s volunteer activities on behalf of a debtor. But that is not the standard to determine whether a conflict of interest exists. See RPC 1.7(a)(2). The “mere possibility” of harm, let alone displeasure, does not require consent. Model Rules of Prof l Conduct R. 1.7, supra, cmt. 8. Under the facts presented in this matter, we do not find a “significant risk” that a volunteer lawyer’s representation of a Chapter 7 debtor in a no-asset case will be “materially limited” by the firm’s responsibilities to creditors in unrelated matters, or that representation of those creditors will be “materially limited” by the firm’s obligations to the debtor. See RPC 1.7(a)(2). To the extent the ACPE articulated a different standard, we do not follow it.\nVLJ reports that in the four-year history of the clinic, no creditor has objected to the discharge of a client’s debt in the one hundred eases handled so far. Once again, if a creditor were to object to the discharge, VLJ would arrange for another volunteer attorney outside the firm to handle the case. Just the same, VLJ advises that no creditor has yet appeared at a section 341 meeting to question the debtor. If that happened, it could strain the lawyer’s duty of loyalty to either client, even if the creditor chose not to object. As a result, we find that another attorney from outside the firm should be substituted to assist the debtor under those circumstances.\nVII.\nThis Court “enacted the RPCs with the public interest as a paramount consideration.” Borteck v. Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti, LLP, 179 N.J. 246, 259, 844 A.2d 521 (2004). The strong policy in favor of pro bono legal services therefore informs our decision as well.\nVolunteering one’s time and expertise to help people who need legal services that they cannot afford is in keeping with the finest traditions of the practice of law. See In re Guardianship of G.S., III, 137 N.J. 168, 175, 644 A.2d 1088 (1994); Madden v. Delran, 126 N.J. 591, 595, 601 A.2d 211 (1992). That noble tradition spans centuries.\nDuring the Reconstruction Era, the Freedmen’s Bureau arranged for private lawyers from the District of Columbia and some southern states to assist poor African-Americans in criminal and civil cases. Jeremy Miller with Vallori Hard, Pro Bono: Historical Analysis and, a Case Study, 21 W. St. U.L.Rev. 483,488 (1994). In 1876, the first legal aid society in America, later known as the New York Legal Aid Society, began to assist poor German immigrants in landlord-tenant disputes and other civil matters. See Marlene Coir, Pro Bono and Access to Justice in America: A Few Historical Markers, 90 Mich. B.J. 54, 54 (2011). During the civil rights movement more than seventy-five years later, local bar associations worked with legal aid groups to help offer services. See id. at 55. And in recent years, large, private law firms “have become crucial drivers” of pro bono efforts, as this appeal shows. Scott Cummings & Rebecca Sandefur, Beyond the Numbers: What We Know—and Should Know—About American Pro Bono, 7 Harv. L. & Polây Rev. 83, 84 (2013) (noting that pro bono hours at two hundred largest law firms have increased nearly eighty percent from 1998 to 2005).\nNew Jersey’s Rules of Professional Conduct specifically address pro bono service. RPC 6.1 declares that\n[elvery lawyer has a professional responsibility to render public interest legal service. A lawyer may discharge this responsibility by providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to persons of limited means or to public service or charitable groups or organizations, by service in activities for improving the law, the legal system or the legal profession, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.\nThis obligation has even greater meaning today. Low-income residents in New Jersey who face civil legal challenges are often unable to get legal help. Legal Services of New Jersey, New Jersey’s Civil Legal Assistance Gap 4 (2012), available at www. lsnj.org/PDFs/NJ_Civil_Legal% 20Assistance_Gap_2012.pdf (reporting that fewer than one in six low-income residents can secure needed legal assistance for civil problems). In mortgage foreclosure eases, evictions, immigration matters, and other areas, too many people have to respond to important legal challenges without the help of a lawyer.\nThe same is true for the growing number of bankruptcies in the wake of the recession. More than 1.3 million bankruptcies were filed nationwide during the one-year period ending March 31, 2012. United States Courts, President Signs Temporary Bankruptcy Judgeships Extension Act (May 31, 2012), http://news. uscourts.gov/president-signs-temporary-bankruptey-judgeshipsextension-act. That amounted to more than 400,000 additional filings compared to the same period in 2008. Id. The growth in self-represented filings has been even greater. During the five-year period from 2006 to 2011, pro se Chapter 7 filings increased 208% nationally. United States Courts, By the Numbers—Pro Se Filers in the Bankruptcy Courts (Oct. 2011), www.useourts.gov/ news/TheThirdBranch/ll-10-01/By_the_Numbers—Pro_Se_ FilersJn_theJ3ankruptcy_Courts.aspx.\nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code is a technical area not designed for the layperson. Not surprisingly, self-represented litigants are less successful in getting their debts discharged under Chapter 7 than debtors who are represented by lawyers. A survey of Chapter 7 filings in 2007 revealed that “17.6 percent of unrepresented debtors had their cases dismissed or converted” but “only 1.9 percent of debtors with lawyers met this fate.” Angela Littwin, The Affordability Paradox: How Consumer Bankruptcy’s Greatest Weakness May Account for its Surprising Success, 52 Wm. & Mary L.Rev. 1933,1971-72 (2011).\nPrograms like VLJ’s clinic help address this crisis, as volunteer lawyers try to pave the way for debtors to recover financially. We commend the lawyers in this and other pro bono initiatives who offer their skill and help at a time of need. By doing so, they help bridge the justice gap that leaves many low-income residents in New Jersey without legal services.\nVIII.\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the ACPE’s final action. We conclude that volunteer attorneys can continue to represent low-income debtors in no-asset Chapter 7 bankruptcy matters consistent with the principles outlined above.\nFor reversal—Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA and Judges RODRÍGUEZ (temporarily assigned) and CUFF (temporarily assigned)—7.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE ALBIN delivered the opinion of the Court.\nIn the sexual assault trial of fourteen-year-old Alex, the family court admitted into evidence pursuant to N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) -the tender-years exception to the hearsay rule-the video-recorded statement that seven-year-old John gave to police, in which he alleged that Alex had sexually touched him on a school bus. John, who suffers from severe developmental disabilities, who during out-of-court and in-court questioning was unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and who was declared incompetent as a witness by the court, was permitted to testify pursuant to the incompetency proviso of N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27). According to the proviso, \"no child whose statement is to be offered in evidence pursuant to [ N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) ] shall be disqualified\" to testify, even though the child witness is deemed incompetent under the requirements of N.J.R.E. 601.\nBased on John's recorded statement, his incompetent testimony, and an utterance he made to his mother's cousin, the family court adjudicated Alex delinquent of committing sexual assault.\nThe Appellate Division found that John's incompetency, as evident from his inability to answer truthfully even simple questions, rendered him unavailable for cross-examination. The Appellate Division therefore determined that the admission of the juvenile's in-court testimony and the video-recorded statement violated Alex's confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment, as articulated in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and its progeny. The Appellate Division did not disturb the juvenile adjudication but rather remanded to the family court to determine whether sufficient evidence remained to support that adjudication.\nWe now reverse Alex's delinquency adjudication on state-law grounds. We conclude that the juvenile's video-recorded statement was not admissible because the statement did not possess a sufficient probability of trustworthiness to justify its introduction at trial under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27). The resolution of the admissibility of the recorded statement based on our evidence rules ultimately renders unnecessary the Appellate Division's constitutional analysis and determination. Striking the juvenile's recorded statement from the record does not leave sufficient evidence in the record to support, on any rational basis, the adjudication of delinquency against Alex. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and hold that the sexual assault charge must be dismissed.\nThe Appellate Division's critique, however, has led us to conclude that the incompetency proviso of the present version of N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) is flawed, and therefore we remand that rule for review to the Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence.\nI.\nA.\nFourteen-year-old Alex was charged in a juvenile delinquency complaint with committing an act of sexual assault \"by contact\" on seven-year-old John on July 3, 2014 in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(b). The complaint specifically alleged that Alex \"on one occasion rubbed [John's] penis with his hand.\" The alleged assault occurred on a bus that was transporting eighteen special-needs children home from summer school. John has been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and his intellectual development corresponded to that of a three-year-old.\nThe State's case depended largely on a comment made by John to his mother's cousin Grace after he exited the bus, John's recorded statement given to a detective eighteen days later, and John's testimony at the juvenile trial. Alex's defense consisted of a general denial that the assault occurred. Among other witnesses, Alex presented the bus aide and the bus driver, both of whom suggested that the assault could not have happened as described by John, given the seating arrangements on the bus and their observations that day.\nB.\nThe family court conducted a Rule 104 hearing, pursuant to N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), to determine the admissibility of the statements John made to Grace and the detective. The only issue before this Court is the admissibility of John's recorded statement to the detective.\nAt the hearing, the State called Grace and Detective David Abromaitis of the Special Victims Unit of the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, and the defense called Dr. Gerald Cooke, a board-certified forensic psychologist.\nGrace testified that on July 3, 2014, she went to the bus stop to pick up John from summer school. She arrived after John had exited the bus. When she first observed John, Alex was holding him by the hand. That struck Grace as unusual, and she told the bus driver that he should not have let John off the bus until she arrived. While walking home, John told Grace that \"[Alex] touched his belly button and pee-pee.\"\nGrace did not ask any follow-up questions, such as when and where the touching occurred or about the circumstances of the event. Grace later called John's mother and had no further discussion with John about the subject.\nJohn's mother reported the incident to the Hoboken Police Department five days later.\nDetective Abromaitis testified about his fourteen-minute recorded interview at the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office on July 21, 2014-eighteen days after the first report to Grace. The recording was played in its entirety at the hearing.\nThe interview began with Detective Abromaitis introducing himself as Dave, a police officer, and in response to the first perfunctory question, \"What's up,\" John stated, \"[Alex] touched my pee-pee.\" Detective Abromaitis explained that he did not conduct a pre-interview of John and met him for the first time when John entered the interview room-and therefore did not prompt John's response. When the detective followed up and asked who touched him, John responded, \"[Alex] touched my pee-pee. He touched my belly button. He touched my belly button, and everybody all laughed at me.\" John indicated that the touching occurred \"[u]nderneath my clothes.\" He also stated, \"He touched my eye. He touched my hand. He touched my eyebrows. He touched my nose like this. He touched my mouth. He touched my legs.\" However, when John showed the detective where he was touched using anatomical dolls, without prompting, he stated, \"He touched at me by accident.\" On an anatomical drawing, John referred to his \"butt\" as both his belly button and his behind, and at one point he referred to his navel as his \"dingaleg.\"\nIn response to a leading question, John recalled that he was at home when the touching occurred, until the detective asked another leading question, and then John recalled that he was on the bus. That colloquy is set forth below:\n[DETECTIVE ABROMAITIS:] Okay[.] [C]an you tell me where you were when [Alex] touched you? Were you at home?\n[JOHN:] Yes, I was at home.\n[DETECTIVE ABROMAITIS:] Or were you somewhere else?\n[JOHN:] Somewhere else [inaudible].\n[DETECTIVE ABROMAITIS:] So where were you? When you say somewhere else, where's somewhere else?\n[JOHN:] I don't know.\n[DETECTIVE ABROMAITIS:] Okay[.] [W]ere you on the bus?\n[JOHN:] Yes[.] [Y]es.\nDetective Abromaitis never asked John where he was seated on the bus or whether he was seated next to Alex.\nJohn told the detective that he lived with \"Chowder and Clarence\" (cartoon characters), his \"mom,\" his friend Jacob, and \"dragons, too.\" In speaking with John's mother, the detective learned that they lived only with John's brother, Joe.\nDr. Cooke criticized Detective Abromaitis's interview techniques. He found fault with the detective's failure to inquire whether John could distinguish between the truth and a lie or between fantasy and reality, particularly given that the child \"cognitively\" was more like a three-year-old than a seven-year-old. Dr. Cooke also criticized the detective for asking leading questions that suggested that the incident occurred on the bus and for not making further inquiry when John said the touching was \"by accident.\"\nThe family court ruled that John's recorded statement was sufficiently \"trustworthy on the basis of the time[,] content and circumstances of the statement\" and therefore would be admissible at trial, provided that John was available to testify. Although the court agreed with Dr. Cooke that Detective Abromaitis broke with the \"ideal\" protocol by not asking John \"any questions to determine whether or not he understood the difference between telling the truth and telling the lie\" and acknowledged that the detective asked an improper leading question that suggested to John that he was on the bus, it nevertheless found \"that the statement is probably trustworthy in the language of [ N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) ].\"\nThe court also conditionally admitted into evidence the comment John made to Grace, finding that the statement \"was completely spontaneous\" and \"probably trustworthy in the totality of the circumstances.\"\nC.\nThe next day, the family court presided over the bench trial on the sexual assault charge lodged against Alex. The first witness called by the State was John. The court asked John some preliminary questions to explore his competency to testify under N.J.R.E. 601.\nThe inquiry made clear that John had difficulty responding to simple questions in an accurate or truthful way. For example, the court showed John a red toy. When asked whether if told the red toy was green that would be the truth, John replied, \"yes.\" When asked the same question again, he said, \"no.\" John also identified a tie as red, but when asked if told that the tie was green, whether that would be the truth, he responded, \"yes.\" The colloquy further developed that John had difficulty distinguishing between what is real and not real.\n[COURT:] And what kind of toy is the other one, what is that?\n[JOHN:] Dinosaur. A dinosaur.\n[COURT:] A dinosaur, okay. Now if I told you that the dinosaur, if I told you that that toy that you say is a dinosaur is a chicken, would that be the truth?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[COURT:] It would be. Do you know the difference between the truth and a lie?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[COURT:] You do, what is it?\n[JOHN:] I don't know.\n[COURT:] You don't know?\n[JOHN:] Yeah. Yes.\nJohn's difficulty comprehending and responding to questions became further evident during the prosecutor's preliminary examination:\n[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Do you know-this is a courtroom, right?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Now if I tell you we're at McDonald's, would that be the truth or would it be a lie?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Yes, it would be the truth or a lie?\n[JOHN:] Yes. Yes. Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. When you talk to mommy, do you have to tell her the truth or do you tell her a lie?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Which one do you do for her?\n[JOHN:] I don't know. I don't know.\nBased on the exchanges above, the court concluded that John was not \"competent to testify.\" Nevertheless, pursuant to N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), which allows a juvenile witness to testify despite his incompetency, the court allowed the prosecutor to proceed with John's direct examination. The brief examination revealed that John could convey little reliable information. Although it was undisputed that John took a bus to summer school, he responded to a question about how he went to school by stating, \"I was walking on the street.\"\nThe prosecutor requested permission to recall John on another day, a request the court subsequently granted. The trial resumed several days later, and the prosecutor continued taking testimony from John. Again, John had difficulty answering simple questions. He stated that, \"It's right,\" if the prosecutor referred to a spider as a flower. Additionally, the following example shows how susceptible John was to leading questions:\n[PROSECUTOR:] If I tell you that this is black, is it really black?\n[JOHN:] Yes. Yes. Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] It's really black or is it red?\n[JOHN:] It's red.\nIn response to a series of questions by the prosecutor, John responded that Alex, whom he identified in the courtroom, touched him on \"my clothes, my pee-pee and my butt\" while seated on the bus.\n[PROSECUTOR:] [John], do you know why we're here today?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Why are we here today?\n[JOHN:] I don't know.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Did anything happen this summer on the school bus?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] What happened?\n[JOHN:] [Alex] touched me.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. And where did he touch you?\n[JOHN:] Right here and right here and here.\n[PROSECUTOR:] When you say here, what part of your body is that?\n[JOHN:] My skin.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. And exactly what part?\n[JOHN:] My-my clothes, my pee-pee and my butt.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Were you sitting on the bus or were you standing?\n[JOHN:] Sitting on the bus.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Were there other people around?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Who was around?\n[JOHN:] [Alex] and Jay. That's it.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Do you see [Alex] here today?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. Where do you see him?\n[JOHN:] On the bus.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Do you see him here today?\n[JOHN:] Yes.\n[PROSECUTOR:] Can you do me a favor, [John]? I'm just going to ask you to stand up for one second and you tell me where you see him?\n[JOHN:] Right there.\nDuring the defense examination, John stated that the \"little kids\" were separated from the \"big kids\" on the bus and that as one of the smaller kids he sat at the front of the bus. John also admitted that another boy named Alex-not defendant-was on the bus and sat near him.\nAlthough the family court found that John lacked \"competency\" as a witness, it nevertheless concluded that John's incompetency did not render him unavailable as a witness. The court therefore declined to exclude from evidence John's statements to the detective and Grace or to dismiss the case.\nThe defense presented three witnesses.\nLeslie Dorsey-Jones testified that she was the bus aide who traveled with Alex and John and approximately sixteen other children as they returned home from school on July 3. She stated that the \"big kids,\" such as Alex, sat in the back of the bus and the \"small kids\" sat in the front of the bus-and that she sat in the middle, separating the two groups. She maintained that Alex \"was sitting in the back, like behind me ..., but I know he wasn't sitting with the other little boy. I know that for a fact.\" She neither heard nor saw anything amiss.\nReuben Quinones, the school bus driver that day, corroborated that the little kids were seated in the front of the bus and big kids in the back. He identified Alex as a \"big kid\" who would have been in the back. Quinones periodically used his overhead mirror to view the interior of the bus and did not see or hear anything that gave him concern.\nThe final defense witness was Lisa Cruz, the transportation liaison for the Hoboken Board of Education, who confirmed that two children named Alex were on the bus that day, one of whom went to elementary school and the other to high school.\nAt the conclusion of the case, the family court found \"that the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alex] purposely committed an act of sexual contact\" by touching \"[John's] penis underneath his clothes.\" The court further determined that the \"intentional touching\" was for the purpose of degrading or humiliating John and of sexually arousing or gratifying Alex. The court acknowledged that John had \"the developmental cognition of a three-year-old,\" a \"lack [of] competency to testify,\" and \"was not able to distinguish or to articulate what his understanding was between right and wrong or the consequences of not telling the truth.\" Nevertheless, the court maintained that \"when it came to the incident itself [John] understood the questions, and he answered coherently in a responsive way and consistently.\"\nAfter adjudicating Alex delinquent, the court imposed a special condition that Alex attend a residential sex-offender treatment program.\nD.\nAlex appealed, claiming that the admission of John's statement to the detective and his incompetent testimony violated our evidence rules. In particular, Alex argued that John's out-of-court statement \"was not sufficiently trustworthy for admission under the 'tender years' hearsay exception, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27),\" and that basing a juvenile adjudication on the uncorroborated hearsay testimony of an incompetent witness was reversible error. Alex also asserted that the adjudication was not supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, he maintained that John's incompetency rendered him unavailable for meaningful cross-examination and thus the admission of his hearsay statement violated the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, as construed by Crawford v. Washington.\nE.\nThe Appellate Division held that because John was incompetent to testify he was effectively unavailable for cross-examination, and therefore the admission of his incriminating testimonial statement to Detective Abromaitis violated Alex's federal confrontation rights. State in Interest of A.R., 447 N.J. Super. 485, 490, 149 A.3d 297 (App. Div. 2016). The panel did not address any of the state-law evidentiary claims that Alex argued were grounds for reversing his adjudication.\nApplying the dictates of the Crawford line of cases, the panel first concluded that John's statement to Detective Abromaitis was testimonial, triggering the constitutional requirement that John be available for cross-examination. Id. at 516-21, 149 A.3d 297. Second, the court determined John's incompetence did not afford Alex a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine John about the accusations he made to the detective. Id. at 521, 523, 149 A.3d 297. More broadly, the panel reached the conclusion that the incompetency proviso, when \"applied to a child's hearsay statements made in a testimonial setting,\" violates the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. Id. at 516, 149 A.3d 297.\nThus, after striking as evidence John's video-recorded statement and his testimony, the panel remanded to the family court to assess whether the State's remaining evidence is sufficient to meet its burden to prove the juvenile adjudication beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 525, 149 A.3d 297. In the interim, the Appellate Division did not disturb the delinquency adjudication. Ibid.\nF.\nWe granted the State's petition for certification. 230 N.J. 425, 168 A.3d 1184 (2017). The John J. Gibbons Fellowship in Public Interest and Constitutional Law at Gibbons P.C. appeared as amicus curiae in support of Alex.\nII.\nA.\nIn seeking reversal of the Appellate Division's decision, the State advances two arguments. First, it maintains that John, who functioned at the level of a three-year-old and was declared incompetent to testify, did not make a \"testimonial statement\"-a statement uttered with the primary purpose that it be used in a later criminal prosecution-and therefore the Confrontation Clause is inapplicable. In other words, the admissibility of John's recorded statement did not depend on whether he was subject to cross-examination. Second, the State contends that, regardless of the declaration of incompetency, John took the stand, and the defense subjected him to cross-examination, thus satisfying the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.\nB.\nAlex counters that John's accusatory statement to the detective meets the standard of a testimonial statement and therefore its admission required that John be available for meaningful cross-examination. Alex argues that meaningful cross-examination could not and did not occur because of John's incompetency, resulting in a violation of Alex's confrontation rights.\nC.\nWe do not address the constitutional issues reached by the Appellate Division or by the parties and amicus curiae because this matter can be resolved by resort to our evidence rules. We have often stated, \"[c]ourts should not reach a constitutional question unless its resolution is imperative to the disposition of litigation.\" Randolph Town Ctr., L.P. v. County of Morris, 186 N.J. 78, 80, 891 A.2d 1202 (2006). Thus, \"we do not address constitutional questions when a narrower, non-constitutional result is available.\" USDA v. Scurry, 193 N.J. 492, 500 n.4, 940 A.2d 1164 (2008) (citing Randolph Town Ctr., 186 N.J. at 80, 891 A.2d 1202 ). More particularly, admission of hearsay statements should first be resolved under our rules of evidence. See State v. Branch, 182 N.J. 338, 354, 865 A.2d 673 (2005) ; see also State v. Buda, 195 N.J. 278, 298, 949 A.2d 761 (2008). Only if those hearsay statements satisfy the admissibility requirements of our evidence rules should we analyze whether the introduction of those out-of-court statements violates the Confrontation Clause. See Branch, 182 N.J. at 354, 865 A.2d 673 (finding hearsay statements inadmissible under our evidence rules and therefore opting not \"to decide the constitutional challenge\" advanced under Confrontation Clause).\nBefore addressing whether John's video-recorded statement to the detective met the admissibility requirements of N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), we review the origin and evolution of the tender-years exception.\nIII.\nWe begin with the language of the tender-years exception to the hearsay rule. N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) provides:\nA statement by a child under the age of 12 relating to sexual misconduct committed with or against that child is admissible in a criminal, juvenile, or civil proceeding if (a) the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party an intention to offer the statement and the particulars of the statement at such time as to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it; (b) the court finds, in a hearing conducted pursuant to Rule 104(a), that on the basis of the time, content and circumstances of the statement there is a probability that the statement is trustworthy; and (c) either (i) the child testifies at the proceeding, or (ii) the child is unavailable as a witness and there is offered admissible evidence corroborating the act of sexual abuse; provided that no child whose statement is to be offered in evidence pursuant to this rule shall be disqualified to be a witness in such proceeding by virtue of the requirements of Rule 601.\n[ (emphasis added).]\nThe emphasized portion of the rule is known as the incompetency proviso. As is evident from the rule, no matter the nature of the incompetency of a child witness, that incompetency cannot disqualify the child as a witness when the State seeks to introduce a prior statement of the child that meets the rule's other requirements. This version of the incompetency proviso differs from the one originally adopted by this Court and the Legislature.\nThe source of the current tender-years exception, including its incompetency proviso, is State v. D.R., 109 N.J. 348, 537 A.2d 667 (1988). In D.R., we recognized that, in a child-sex-abuse prosecution, \"testimony by the victim is often the indispensable element of the [State's] case.\" Id. at 358, 537 A.2d 667. We determined that our evidence rules needed an additional \"exception[ ] to the hearsay rule to authorize under certain conditions the admissibility of testimony relating the out-of-court statements of a child victimized by sexual abuse.\" Ibid. In fashioning a proposed rule, we looked to other jurisdictions' rules and statutes, the American Bar Association's recommendations, and learned commentators for guidance. Id. at 358-63, 537 A.2d 667.\nIn crafting this new exception to the hearsay rule, we acknowledged that \"a prerequisite to the admissibility of a child's out-of-court statement concerning sexual abuse is that it possess sufficient indicia of reliability\" and that any \"modification of the hearsay rule must adequately recognize and protect the substantial constitutional interests of defendants in such proceedings.\" Id. at 363, 537 A.2d 667. Importantly, we recognized that any new exception to the hearsay rule had to conform to the demands of the Confrontation Clause, which-in the pre- Crawford era-\"required (1) availability of the declarant for cross-examination or a demonstration of unavailability, and (2) assurances of reliability.\" Id. at 366, 537 A.2d 667 ; see also Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).\nWe also grappled with \"[t]he most difficult question ... [:] whether a child's incompetency to testify at trial should preclude admissibility of the child's out-of-court statement.\" D.R., 109 N.J. at 365, 537 A.2d 667. We expressed concern that a child's incompetency, which would bar the child's testimony, might not constitute unavailability for purposes of Roberts and therefore would present an insurmountable obstacle to the admission of the child-victim's out-of-court statement. Id. at 369-70, 537 A.2d 667. That concern gave rise to the incompetency proviso. Although the language of today's tender-years exception, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), is almost identical to the one proposed in D.R. and adopted in Rule 63(33) (currently renumbered as N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) ), the incompetency proviso is different.\nThe incompetency proviso proposed in D.R. and adopted in Rule 63(33) read as follows: \"provided that no child whose statement is to be offered in evidence pursuant to this rule shall be disqualified to be a witness in such proceeding by virtue of the requirements of paragraph (b) of Rule 17.\" Id. at 378, 537 A.2d 667 (emphasis added). Importantly, for our discussion here,\n[w]e conclude[d] that the disqualification set forth in paragraph (b) of Evidence Rule 17 should not apply in a sexual abuse prosecution in which the victim's out-of-court statement is offered in evidence. A finding that a child-victim is \"incapable of understanding the duty ... to tell the truth,\" and thus incompetent, is difficult to reconcile with a ruling that admits into evidence, insulated from cross-examination, the out-of-court statements of the same child made several months prior to trial.\n[ Id. at 369-70, 537 A.2d 667 (third alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Evid. R. 17).]\nThe proposed language was adopted in 1989 as Rule 63(33) and later recast as N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) in 1993 when our evidence rules were renumbered to parallel the Federal Rules of Evidence.\nRule 17-the predecessor competency rule-corresponds to our current N.J.R.E. 601. Rule 17 provided:\nA person is disqualified to be a witness if the judge finds that (a) the proposed witness is incapable of expressing himself concerning the matter so as to be understood by the judge and jury either directly or through interpretation by one who can understand him, or (b) the proposed witness is incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth.\nThe incompetency proviso in the tender-years exception adopted by D.R. rendered inoperative only paragraph (b) of the competency rule. That apparently was to address, in part, the notion that \"[a] child's age in itself cannot render him incompetent as a witness,\" D.R., 109 N.J. at 369 n.8, 537 A.2d 667, and that there is a difference, for a child, between understanding \"the duty\" to tell the truth and having the capacity to tell the truth in a manner that is understandable by the trier of fact. The tender-years exception approved in D.R., however, did not allow a child deemed incompetent under paragraph (a) of Rule 17 to testify. Rule 17(a) corresponds directly with N.J.R.E. 601(a).\nIn May 1989, the Legislature adopted Rule 63(33) as proposed in D.R. See Joint Res. No. 4 (1989). The rule remained in effect, verbatim, until the 1993 renumbering of the Rules of Evidence, when Rule 63(33) became N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) and Rule 17 became N.J.R.E. 601. Something more happened, however. The scope of the incompetency proviso was broadened by the removal of the reference to paragraph (b). Thus, the proviso now reads, \"no child whose statement is to be offered in evidence pursuant to this rule shall be disqualified to be a witness in such proceeding by virtue of the requirements of Rule 601.\" N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) (emphasis added). The consequences of this expansion are significant and far-reaching because it permits the testimony of a child victim not only incapable of understanding the duty to tell the truth but also incapable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality and of expressing himself in a manner to be understood by a judge or jury.\nNothing in the historical record of the evolution of the tender-years exception suggests that this Court or the Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence intended that a child rendered incompetent for reasons other than an inability to understand the duty to tell the truth would be permitted to testify at trial. Allowing the testimony of a child witness, who is declared incompetent because he \"is incapable of expression concerning the matter so as to be understood by the judge and jury,\" would have been a significant change to N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), yet it is never mentioned in the Evidence Committee's Report.\nThe record concerning the promulgation of N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) provides no clear explanation or justification for the removal of the reference to paragraph (b) of the competency rule. When the Committee recommended an alteration to the rule, it did so explicitly. Significantly, it recommended applying the rule to civil and juvenile proceedings. See Meeting Minutes, Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence 2 (May 17, 1993) (\" N.J.R.E. 803 [ (c)(27) ] ... shall incorporate the present language of Evidence Rule 63(33) and enlarge its scope to make it applicable to civil and to juvenile proceedings. Approved by the Committee unanimously with one abstention.\"); see also Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence, Amendatory Report (May 17, 1993). The Evidence Committee gave no indication that it intended to provide for the admissibility of incompetent testimony lacking indicia of reliability because it was uttered by a sex-abuse victim of tender years. The Committee's seeming silence on this important matter suggests that the Committee may not have focused on expanding the incompetency proviso in N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27).\nThe wholesale allowance of incompetent child testimony evidently prompted the Appellate Division to address the constitutional issue raised, in light of our current confrontation clause jurisprudence, which, under Crawford, prohibits the \"admission of testimonial statements of a witness who [does] not appear at trial unless he [is] unavailable to testify, and the defendant [has] had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\" 541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Another point of concern is the incongruence between, on the one hand, generally disallowing incompetent child testimony, and on the other, allowing incompetent testimony without limitation if the child has uttered a prior statement. D.R. made clear that less exacting standards of competency should apply to a child witness, but did not go so far as to completely suspend the competency rule for child testimony.\nAccordingly, we request that the Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence consider whether N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) should be amended to conform to the evidence rule adopted in D.R. and whether any other amendment is advisable as a result of the concerns raised in this case.\nIV.\nWe nevertheless must address the application of the current tender-years exception to the case before us. We cannot conclude that N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), as presently constructed, authorized the admission of John's video-recorded statement to the detective.\nBefore admitting a child's out-of-court statement pursuant to N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), the trial court must make certain findings at a Rule 104 hearing. The court must determine whether \"on the basis of the time, content and circumstances of the statement there is a probability that the statement is trustworthy.\" N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27). The statement's admissibility is also conditioned on either the child testifying or, if the child is unavailable as a witness, on the presentation of \"admissible evidence corroborating the act of sexual abuse.\" Ibid. When the child-victim's statement is a sexual accusation made to police, the statement generally will be classified as a \"testimonial statement.\" State v. Nyhammer, 197 N.J. 383, 411-12, 963 A.2d 316 (2009) (finding that child's videotaped statement alleging sexual crimes \"-given to a law enforcement officer investigating a crime-constitutes testimonial hearsay for Sixth Amendment purposes\"). The admissibility of a child's testimonial statement, therefore, will be conditioned on the child taking the stand. State v. P.S., 202 N.J. 232, 249, 997 A.2d 163 (2010) (noting that admissibility of child victim's statement is conditioned on not only \"judicial finding of trustworthiness,\" but also \"opportunity to cross-examine the child at trial\" (quoting State v. R.B., 183 N.J. 308, 318, 873 A.2d 511 (2005) ) ); see also State v. D.G., 157 N.J. 112, 124, 723 A.2d 588 (1999).\nIn the present case, the primary issue under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) is whether there was a probability that John's video-recorded statement to the detective was \"trustworthy\" based on \"the time, content and circumstances of the statement.\" A court must \"consider 'the totality of the circumstances' \" in determining whether the statement is sufficiently trustworthy to warrant its admission. P.S., 202 N.J. at 249, 997 A.2d 163 (quoting State v. Roman, 248 N.J. Super. 144, 152, 590 A.2d 686 (App. Div. 1991) ). We have identified \"a non-exclusive list of factors relevant to evaluating the reliability of out-of-court statements made by child victims of sexual abuse, including spontaneity, consistent repetition, mental state of the declarant, use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and lack of motive to fabricate.\"\nId. at 249, 997 A.2d 163 (emphases added) (citing Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 821-22, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) ). Clearly, one consideration in assessing a child's mental state must be whether the child is able to distinguish between fantasy and reality and whether the child can communicate in a way that shows the child has the mental capacity to tell the truth and to be understood by the trier of fact. A judicial declaration that a child is incompetent to testify should also have some bearing on determining the admissibility of a child's out-of-court statement.\nV.\nA.\nBefore applying the legal principles to the facts, we first set forth the standard of review that governs this appeal.\nA trial judge's factual finding concerning the admissibility of a child's statement offered under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27) is entitled to deference by an appellate court. See P.S., 202 N.J. at 250-51, 997 A.2d 163. Specifically, \"a trial judge's finding that a child's statement meets the trustworthiness requirement of N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27)\" should not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Id. at 250, 997 A.2d 163. Thus, a factual finding \"supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record\" should be upheld. Ibid. (quoting State v. Elders, 192 N.J. 224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007) ). Only if that finding is clearly mistaken should an appellate court intervene, in the interest of justice, to correct the error. Id. at 250-51, 997 A.2d 163 ; Elders, 192 N.J. at 244, 927 A.2d 1250. In that circumstance, an appellate court may \"appraise the record ... and make its own findings and conclusions.\" P.S., 202 N.J. at 251, 997 A.2d 163 (quoting Elders, 192 N.J. at 244, 927 A.2d 1250 ); see also State v. S.S., 229 N.J. 360, 381, 162 A.3d 1058 (2017) (\"Appellate courts have an important role to play in taking corrective action when factual findings are so clearly mistaken-so wide of the mark-that the interests of justice demand intervention.\").\nB.\nDespite the deference that we must afford the family court's findings in this case, given the totality of the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the court's assessment of the trustworthiness of John's video-recorded statement is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\nBy the family court's own account, John, age seven, had \"the developmental cognition of a three-year-old,\" a \"lack of competency to testify,\" and \"was not able to distinguish or to articulate what his understanding was between right and wrong or the consequences of not telling the truth.\" When John entered the interview room and met with Detective Abromaitis for the first time, eighteen days after the alleged bus incident, John responded to a greeting question, \"What's up,\" with a targeted answer, \"[Alex] touched my pee-pee.\" The detective did not suggest that answer because he had not conducted a pre-interview, but it appears that John was primed for the response. See State v. Michaels, 136 N.J. 299, 309, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994) (\"[F]actors that can undermine the neutrality of an interview and create undue suggestiveness [include] ... the use of leading questions, and a lack of control for outside influences on the child's statements, such as previous conversations with parents or peers.\").\nDuring the interview, John had difficulty distinguishing between different body parts; for example, he called his belly button his \"butt.\" He also claimed to live with cartoon characters, dragons, and a friend who in fact did not reside with him. Given John's developmental disabilities, the interview was challenging for the detective. Nevertheless, the detective did not make the most basic inquiries to assess whether John could tell the difference between the truth and a lie, or reality and fantasy. In response to one leading question, John stated that the touching occurred at home, and in response to another leading question, he stated it occurred on the bus-evidencing John's susceptibility to suggestive questioning. When John indicated that the touching happened by accident, the detective did not follow up.\nThe family court conditionally admitted the video-recorded statement depending on John's availability as a witness. During two days of questioning, John agreed with his interlocutor when it was suggested that a spider is a flower and that the color black is red. John stated that he walked on the street to summer school, although no one disputed that he took the bus, and he could not articulate whether it was right to tell the truth or a lie to his mother. John, moreover, agreed that the bigger kids were separated from the smaller ones on the bus and that another boy named Alex sat near him. Against this backdrop, John stated repeatedly that Alex touched his pee-pee, although without much elaboration. The sheer repetition of that claim-divorced from everything else-does not make the statement probably trustworthy.\nWe owe the trial court's evidentiary findings reasoned deference, not blind deference. In viewing the totality of the circumstances related to John's accusations in the video-recorded statement, we do not find that sufficient credible evidence supports the conclusion that John's statement was probably trustworthy. Therefore, we hold that the family court abused its discretion in allowing the video-recorded statement into evidence.\nUnder N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), John was allowed to testify, despite his incompetence, to afford protection to Alex's confrontation rights given the admission of the video-recorded hearsay accusation. The general rule barring an incompetent child witness from testifying adheres when the out-of-court statement is not admissible. In light of our determination that John's video-recorded statement was wrongly admitted into evidence, his trial testimony should not have been introduced for the purpose of confronting that statement. However, John's incompetent testimony still was admissible because of the introduction of John's hearsay statement to Grace under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27). In effect, the hearsay statement serves to bootstrap into evidence the incompetent testimony.\nVI.\nLast, after excising from the record John's video-recorded statement, the remaining evidence-even when viewed in the light most favorable to the State-is insufficient to support a sexual-assault adjudication beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Reyes, 50 N.J. 454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967).\nThe remaining evidence consists of John's incompetent testimony and Grace's hearsay testimony that, as John walked home with her after exiting the bus, he said, \"[Alex] touched his belly button and pee-pee.\" Nothing more was said to Grace on the subject. The statement provides limited information and no context. For example, it does not tell us whether the alleged touching was accidental, which of the two Alexes did the touching, or when and where the incident occurred. In addition, no competent evidence corroborates John's single statement made to Grace. Weighing against that evidence is the testimony of the bus aide who unequivocally averred that the big kids, such as Alex, sat in the back of the bus, and the little kids, such as John, sat in the front. The aide testified that Alex sat behind her and that she knew \"for a fact\" that Alex and John did not sit next to each other. The bus driver also confirmed that the children were separated by size and age, and both he and the aide stated that they neither saw nor heard anything amiss during the ride. Even John stated that the small boys sat at the front of the bus and he sat near a little boy named Alex. Indeed, two boys named Alex-one little and one big-were on the bus that day. Finally, the State provided no evidence that the touching-if there was a touching-was intentional and done \"for the purpose of degrading or humiliating the victim or sexually arousing or sexually gratifying the actor.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:14-1(d).\nBecause we resolve this case on state-law grounds, we need not tackle the constitutional issue at the heart of the Appellate Division's opinion-whether the admission of John's incompetent testimony denied Alex his Sixth Amendment confrontation right. We neither address nor endorse the Appellate Division's constitutional analysis.\nNo purpose would be served by remanding this matter to the family court when we have determined that a rational factfinder could reach but one conclusion-that the remaining evidence is insufficient to support the sexual-assault adjudication against Alex.\nVII.\nFor the reasons expressed, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division, which remanded the case to the family court for further factfinding based on the remaining record. Because we find that the record clearly establishes that there is insufficient evidence to support the delinquency adjudication, we order that the delinquency charge against Alex be dismissed. We remand to the family court for the entry of that judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES LaVECCHIA, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, and TIMPONE join in JUSTICE ALBIN's opinion.\nWe use fictitious names to identify the juvenile defendant and the alleged victim, and the victim's relatives to protect their privacy.\nN.J.R.E. 104(a) provides the vehicle for the court to conduct a hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence that is subject to a condition before the evidence may be introduced at trial.\nThe transcript of the video-recorded statement was prepared by the Prosecutor's Office and moved into evidence. The family court, however, indicated during its admissibility ruling that it \"did not hear the juvenile say that the alleged incident happened at home\" when listening to and reviewing the recording. As agreed to by the parties, defense counsel cross-examined Detective Abromaitis based on the transcript.\nThe Appellate Division recognized that \"courts generally prefer to steer away from constitutional questions if their resolution is not essential to a case,\" but believed that Alex \"concede[d] in his brief that the hearsay statements of [John] were admissible as a matter of state evidence law under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27).\" A.R., 447 N.J. Super. at 515, 149 A.3d 297. We do not find such a concession. To the contrary, Alex asserted in his brief that John's out-of-court statement to Detective Abromaitis \"was not sufficiently trustworthy for admission under the 'tender years' hearsay exception, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27).\" Additionally, at oral argument before this Court, Alex's attorney asserted that the defense raised on direct appeal the unreliability of the video-recorded statement and argued it \"should not have been admitted under 803(c)(27).\"\nThe court noted that John's statement to his mother's cousin, Grace, was not testimonial and therefore admissible without the requirement of cross-examination. Id. at 521, 149 A.3d 297. Alex does not challenge the admission of that statement. Ibid.\nThe Attorney General represents the State before this Court, having superseded the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, which represented the State before the family court and Appellate Division.\nThe state-law issues were fully briefed by the parties in the Appellate Division.\nN.J.R.E. 601, the current rule on competency provides:\nEvery person is competent to be a witness unless (a) the judge finds that the proposed witness is incapable of expression concerning the matter so as to be understood by the judge and jury either directly or through interpretation, or (b) the proposed witness is incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth, or (c) except as otherwise provided by these rules or by law.\nA \"testimonial statement\" is defined as one made \"when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ... ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\" Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006).\nBecause the juvenile case proceeded as a bench trial, there was a blending of Rule 104 hearing testimony and trial testimony. For instance, while conditioning the admission of John's video-recorded statement on his availability at trial, the court allowed Grace's testimony at the pre-trial motion hearing to serve as substantive evidence during the trial.\nThat big Alex was holding John's hand outside the bus hardly counts as evidence suggestive of a sexual assault.\nA conviction under the sexual-assault statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(b), requires an \"intentional touching ... for the purpose of degrading or humiliating the victim or sexually arousing or sexually gratifying the actor.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:14-1(d).",

                            "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nFUENTES, P.J.A.D.\nThis case has been besieged by an inordinate amount of complications, some inherent to the issues raised by the parties, others created by a series of unfortunate and misguided decisions of the first judge who presided over the case. We are compelled to address some of the root causes of these problems to adequately review and resolve the legal issues raised by the parties in this appeal. While going about this task, we are mindful to prevent matters extraneous to the appellate process from interfering with our overriding responsibility to provide the parties in this controversy what they are entitled to receive from us: a fair and impartial application of the law to the factual record developed before the trial court.\nAlthough technically there are a number of parties named as litigants in this case, distilled to its essence, this is a civil dispute between two main actors, plaintiff Bruce Kaye and defendant Alan Rosefielde. These two men once enjoyed each other’s company and respected each other’s business acumen. Their professional association appeared mutually beneficial at its inception and held great promise for continued prosperity. Since matters went awry, however, Kaye and Rosefielde have pursued their respective claims against each other with the same passion and zeal that once characterized their success in business. With these observations as prologue, we will now identify the other parties in the case.\nIn addition to Kaye, plaintiffs include: La Sammana Ventures, LLC (La Sammana); First Resorts Management Company, Inc.; Flagship Resort Development, Corp. (Flagship); Atlantic Palace Development, LLC (Atlantic Palace); two trusts created by Kaye, the Bruce Kaye Irrevocable Trust and the Bruce Kaye Dynasty Trust; and Kaye’s son, Jason Kaye (Jason). In addition to Rosefielde, defendants include: two companies under his ownership and control, Plumrose Company, Inc. (Plumrose), and Rose Associates, Inc. (Rose Associates); and two other companies that he co-owned with entities or individuals that were associated with Kaye, La Sammana Management, LLC, and BA Management, LLC (BA Management).\nRosefielde had an employment relationship with Flagship, Atlantic Palace, and La Sammana, three entities that sold timeshares to consumers. Kaye hired Rosefielde to be the chief operating officer (COO) of Flagship. Rosefielde also assisted Kaye in managing Atlantic Palace and its related companies. Although the parties disagree as to when Rosefielde assumed the role of general counsel, it is not disputed that, at some point prior to 2005, Rosefielde assumed this role with respect to all of the entities that Kaye had an ownership interest in.\nIn 2005, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Atlantic County Chancery Division, alleging that Rosefielde breached his fiduciary responsibility to plaintiffs “[d]uring his tenure as General Counsel,” was an unfaithful servant, committed civil fraud, illegally practiced law in New Jersey, and committed legal malpractice through a series of unethical machinations and fraudulent transactions. Plaintiffs alleged that Rosefielde committed these civil wrongs to conceal his unethical, illegal schemes and to improperly enrich himself at plaintiffs’ expense.\nRosefielde filed a responsive pleading, denying all wrongdoing, and a counterclaim, alleging that he was terminated from his employment as Flagship’s COO in violation of an oral contract and in retaliation for objecting to what he reasonably believed were criminal and unethical activities engaged in or directed by Kaye to defraud the Federal Trade Commission and bribe Atlantic City officials. Rosefielde also grounded his counterclaim on the protections afforded to whistleblowers in the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), N.J.S.A. 34:19-1 to -8. Rosefielde demanded a jury trial in his responsive pleading to Kaye’s complaint and reiterated the demand for a jury trial in his counterclaim, which raised independent affirmative claims for relief. Kaye also demanded a jury trial in his answer to Rosefielde’s counterclaim.\nI\nThis case was first assigned for case management and, if necessary, trial to Judge Steven P. Perskie. For reasons explained in detail by the Supreme Court in In re Perskie, 207 N.J. 275, 24 A.3d 277 (2011), the case was transferred in October 2006 from Judge Perskie and reassigned to Judge William E. Nugent. 207 N.J. at 281-84, 24 A.3d 277. After an eight-week bench trial, Judge Nugent decided the case primarily in plaintiffs’ favor. Although Judge Nugent denied plaintiffs’ application to compel Rosefielde to disgorge his salary, Judge Nugent rescinded Rosefielde’s interests in three Kaye entities, awarded plaintiffs com pensatory damages, punitive damages, and counsel fees, and dismissed Rosefielde’s counterclaim.\nOn appeal, defendants assert that: (1) Judge Nugent erred in finding that Rosefielde violated certain sections of the Rules of Professional Conduct governing the practice of law in this State, specifically with respect to the La Sammana entities; (2) Rose-fielde was entitled to indemnification; (3) the punitive damages award was unwarranted; (4) the facts did not establish that Rosefielde breached any fiduciary duty; (5) plaintiffs’ “fraudulent deed” claims should have been barred pursuant to the entire controversy doctrine; (6) the decision in plaintiffs’ favor improperly relied on inadmissible evidence; (7) the trial court improperly denied Rosefielde’s right to a jury trial on his CEPA and breach of contract claims; and (8) the integrity of the trial was compromised by Judge Perskie’s recusal and subsequent appearances at the proceedings before Judge Nugent. Defendants seek a complete and total reversal of the outcome of the bench trial conducted by Judge Nugent, and request that the case be remanded to a different venue to allow Rosefielde’s claims that are entitled to be decided by a jury to be tried separately from the claims that assert purely equitable relief.\nOn cross-appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in not ordering disgorgement of Rosefielde’s salary based on his breach of fiduciary duty and disloyalty to Kaye and his business entities. Plaintiffs also seek disgorgement of Rosefielde’s salary as general counsel (a/k/a in-house counsel ), because he did not adhere to the ethical rules and procedural safeguards established by the Supreme Court to regulate this particular aspect of the legal profession and was not otherwise authorized to practice law in this State. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have compelled defendants to reimburse three of the individuals who were deposed by Rosefielde in connection with this case for their out-of-pocket expenses and consequential loss of pay.\nAfter carefully reviewing the massive record developed by the parties before the trial court, we affirm, in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\nAs a threshold issue, we affirm Judge Nugent’s invocation and application of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction to deny Rosefieldeâs motion to enforce his demand for a jury trial on his breach of contract and CEPA claims, which were asserted in his counterclaim. Although, under Article I, paragraph 9 of the New Jersey Constitution, a legal action alleging a breach of contract is ordinarily tried before a jury, and notwithstanding the legislative language that “[u]pon the application of any party, a jury trial shall be directed to try the validity of any claim under” CEPA, N.J.S.A. 34:19-5, we are satisfied that Judge Nugent correctly construed the Supreme Court’s holding in Lyn-Anna Properties v. Harborview Development Corp., 145 N.J. 313, 678 A.2d 683 (1996), and properly exercised his discretionary authority to adjudicate the counts in Rosefielde’s counterclaim that sought purely legal relief in the form of compensatory damages.\nWith this holding as backdrop, we affirm Judge Nugent’s decision to rescind Rosefielde’s ownership interests in La Sammana, La Sammana Management, and BA Management, three business entities principally owned by Kaye, as well as the compensatory damages awarded to Kaye in connection with these transactions. With respect to plaintiffs’ claims of legal malpractice and civil fraud, there is sufficient competent evidence in the record to support Judge Nugent’s findings that Rosefielde violated his ethical and professional responsibilities to plaintiffs, both in his capacity as in-house general counsel of Kaye’s business entities and in his role as Kaye’s personal attorney.\nWe vacate, however, Judge Nugent’s award of counsel fees to plaintiffs based on Rosefielde having committed professional malpractice and fraud. The record before us shows that plaintiffs were unable to prove that Rosefielde’s legal malpractice and fraudulent conduct proximately caused any compensable damages to them. We thus remand for the trial court to reconsider and, if necessary, recalculate the amount of counsel fees, if any, that plaintiffs are entitled to receive under the circumstances presented.\nWe also vacate the trial court’s award of punitive damages based on Rosefielde’s fraudulent acquisition of an ownership interest in BA Management and his use of corporate funds to pay for a personal trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. With respect to BA Management, the record before us does not show that Rosefielde’s fraudulent scheme to acquire an ownership interest in this company proximately caused any compensable damages to Kaye. We thus remand for the trial court to reconsider whether an award of punitive damages is sustainable based only on the compensatory damages correctly awarded for Rosefielde’s improper use of corporate funds to pay for his personal trip to Las Vegas.\nWe now turn to the arguments raised by plaintiffs in their cross-appeal. We affirm Judge Nugent’s decision to deny plaintiffs the remedy of disgorgement and forfeiture. Judge Nugent’s factual findings on these two issues are supported by the record, and his legal analysis denying this relief is unassailable.\nBefore we begin our recitation of the relevant facts, we are compelled to dispel any aspersions that might be inferred by our departure from the Appellate Division’s long-held practice of not identifying a trial judge by name in those opinions where we disagree with any part of a judge’s ruling or decision. This practice, grounded on our great respect for the hard work performed by our fellow jurists who are faced with enormous pressure on a daily basis to make extremely complex decisions in the most expeditious way possible, has been rendered inapplicable here for two basic reasons. First, as previously noted, the names of the jurists involved in this case have already been publicly discussed by our Supreme Court in In re Perskie, supra, a published opinion. Second, this case has received a great deal of public attention, in both the traditional media and in our State’s legal periodical of record, the New Jersey Law Journal. To ignore these facts would not only be futile, but it may be misconstrued by some as hypocritical.\nAs noted earlier, Judge Perskie ultimately recused himself from presiding over this trial. As the Supreme Court found, his decision thereafter to appear on two separate occasions as a spectator at the trial that Judge Nugent presided over and to approach and speak with one of Kayeâs attorneys during his second visit to Judge Nugent’s courtroom was “ill-considered” and in violation of Canons 1, 2A, and 3B of the Code of Judicial Conduct. In re Perskie, supra, 207 N.J. at 284, 24 A.3d 277. Defendants argue that Judge Perskieâs undisputed transgressions tainted the impartiality of the proceedings before Judge Nugent. We disagree. Based on this record, we are satisfied that Judge Nugent’s role as fact-finder and legal arbiter was not compromised in any way by Judge Perskie’s conduct. Although we have disagreed with some of the legal rulings he made in this case, Judge Nugent’s integrity as a jurist is beyond reproach.\nII\nRosefielde graduated from law school in 1969 and was not admitted to practice law in New York until 1974. During this five-year hiatus, he worked as a tax advisor and planner in the tax department of a national accounting firm. In 1971, he and an attorney named Arnold Gitmore started an accounting and tax planning business called “Executive Tax Planning.” When Rose-fielde was finally admitted to practice law in New York in 1974, he and Gitmore opened a new firm dedicated to entertainment law called “Rosefielde and Gitmore.” Rosefielde has never been admitted to practice law in New Jersey.\nRosefielde testified that, during the 1970s, he and Gitmore represented a number of well-known entertainers and artists such as Bette Midler, Rod Stewart, Andrew Lloyd Weber, and the Bee Gees; they also represented music companies such as Motown Records. Rosefielde made this impressive client list known to Kaye when the two men first met in 1997. Rosefielde told Kaye he was a tax attorney, a business person, and an investor.\nKaye has enjoyed great success in business despite having had limited formal education. By his own admission, he has a ninth grade education. Shortly after their first meeting, Rosefielde began giving Kaye tax and management-consulting advice concerning Kaye’s companies. For the first four or five years, Kaye paid Rosefielde on an hourly basis for his legal work and for work related to matters involving federal and state taxes. Rosefielde resided in Florida at the time.\nIn 2002, Kaye noted a decline in revenues from his businesses in Atlantic City. He asked Rosefielde to come to Atlantic City to work with him for a few months to improve the operations of his businesses. From September until December 2002, Rosefielde worked out of Kaye’s office in Atlantic City. Satisfied with his performance up to that point, Kaye asked Rosefielde to work for him full-time. Rosefielde accepted and became COO for Flagship and Atlantic Palace. Effective January 2003, Kaye and his companies engaged Rosefielde as an independent contractor, functioning as COO. According to Rosefielde, Kaye promised to reimburse him for travel between his home in Florida and the offices in Atlantic City. As a corporate officer, Rosefielde testified that he was entitled to health benefits and indemnification pursuant to certain provisions in Flagship’s bylaws.\nThe record shows that Rosefielde signed a number of docu- merits identifying himself as the lawyer for Kaye’s companies or as general counsel for Atlantic Palace and Flagship. He submitted monthly statements for “retainers” to both Atlantic Palace and Flagship and also included expenses for travel, meals, entertainment, and medical expenses. Rosefielde’s company, Plumrose, was paid on a monthly basis, resulting in an annual fee to Rosefielde totaling $550,000 in 2003 and $551,000 in 2004; reimbursement for expenses was not included.\nOn January 22, 2003, Kaye sent an interoffice memorandum to all employees at Flagship, Atlantic Palace, and La Sammana, introducing Rosefielde as COO. Kaye described Rosefielde’s attributes as having a “wealth of business knowledge and many successful business ventures including being an attorney and a developer of many real estate projects.” (Emphasis added). On February 7, 2003, Rosefielde sent a memorandum to all department heads, stating that his approval was required for all contracts; approval of purchase requests exceeding $1000 could be approved by either the COO or the chief financial officer (CFO).\nOn October 6, 2003, Rosefielde sent a memorandum to all employees, establishing a chain of command for addressing internal complaints that explicitly excluded Kaye as part of the process. Specifically, after detailing the protocol employees were required to follow, Rosefielde concluded the memorandum with this clear admonition: “In no event should any employee request a meeting with the President/C.E.O. (Bruce Kaye). Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.”\nKaye testified that he considered Rosefielde his corporate attorney, his business attorney, his trust attorney, and his personal attorney. Susan Tunney, former vice president of operations at Flagship, testified that Kaye first introduced Rosefielde as COO. Tunney testified that, sometime after a dinner in 2002, Kaye told her that Rosefielde was an attorney who would be handling all matters with other attorneys. This was particularly significant to Tunney, because she had been dealing directly with other attorneys as part of her role as vice president of operations. Tunney also testified that she accompanied Rosefielde to the federal courthouse in Camden in connection with a case and witnessed Rosefielde identify himself as an attorney to the marshals guarding the courthouse entrance.\nAlthough there was contradictory testimony whether Rosefielde was initially hired to serve as both COO and general counsel, there were numerous occasions where Rosefielde identified himself as general counsel. He also stated at business meetings that he was the only attorney and only person present authorized to offer a legal opinion for the companies. Michael Valenti, the CFO for Atlantic Palace and Flagship, testified that he considered Rosefielde as general counsel and a lawyer. Employees were not permitted to call an outside attorney without Rosefielde’s permission. Kaye testified that his oversight of Rosefielde’s activities was minimal and left operational and legal matters to Rosefielde, because he hired him to be both COO and general counsel.\nIn a memorandum dated March 12, 2004, addressed to the staff of all of the companies, Kaye made clear that in order to “implement [his] vision” and “move [the] organization into the twenty first century,” he needed to “devote [his] time entirely as [CEO] and creating plans for [the companies’] future.” Because this would require “complete attention” on his part, Kaye “decided to turn over all operational functions to the [COO], Alan Rosefielde.” Kaye thus ordered “all departments and divisions without exception, including all aspects of Sales, [to report] to [Rosefielde] effective immediately.”\nIII\nRosefielde assumed the role of de facto CEO and de jure general counsel with great fervor. He renegotiated and restructured lending relationships with Heller Financial, a subsidiary of General Electric, and with Liberty, H.S.B.C., Finova, and Textron; he also oversaw litigation against Wellington Financial Corp. According to Rosefielde, Kaye was thrilled with the results. Commensurately, Rosefielde took advantage of the amenities and prerogatives associated with his position. He regularly dined with managers and took employees and family members to dinner. In his deposition, Kaye admitted that he was aware of Rosefielde’s lavish expenses, dinners, and other ostensibly improper behavior. He was willing to tolerate such conduct due mostly to Rosefielde’s success in refinancing the companies’ debt.\nA\nLA SAMMANA VENTURES\nLa Sammana was a hotel and condominium in Brigantine, which Kaye planned to convert into timeshare units. Kaye created the legal entity “La Sammana Ventures” to own the property.\nThe operating agreement for La Sammana revealed that Kaye held a 70 percent ownership; the remaining 30 percent was equally divided as follows: 10 percent to a Florida lawyer named Dennis Richard; 10 percent held by JFL Ventures, a company owned by Joseph Lattuga, director of sales at Flagship and Atlantic Palace; and 10 percent by the 2000 Bruce Kaye Dynasty Trust, which Kaye had created to benefit his two adult children.\nAccording to Tunney, Rosefielde attempted to sabotage Kaye’s relationship with Lattuga as a means of surreptitiously acquiring Lattuga’s interest in La Sammana. Kaye testified that, beginning in 2004, Rosefielde began to question Lattuga’s abilities regarding his role in the business and whether Lattuga merited the salary he was receiving. This coincided with a change in the “culture” of the business initiated by Kaye in 2001 as a means of keeping up with the changes in the market.\nDespite Rosefieldeâs persistent criticism of Lattuga’s business performance, Kaye testified that he intended to remain loyal to Lattuga. Kaye and Lattuga had had a successful business relationship for over ten years. Kaye testified that Lattuga willingly relocated from Virginia to New Jersey to join Kaye’s then startup operation, leaving a lucrative job that paid Lattuga in excess of $150,000 annually.\nOn or about February 1, 2004, Rosefielde prepared a letter of separation from the company for Lattuga to sign, proposing a severance package. Rosefielde sent the proposed separation agreement to Kevin Wolfe, one of Kaye’s outside counsel. The agreement included a provision for La Sammana to buy back Lattugaâs 10 percent interest. However, there was also a separate “assignment of interest form” included for Lattuga to sign. This document had a blank space for the recipient of his interest. Wolfe made only stylistic changes to the document and was not involved in the assignment of Lattuga’s interest.\nKaye discovered Rosefielde’s alleged scheme to acquire Lattu-ga’s 10 percent interest in La Sammana only when he learned that, approximately a month before the draft separation agreement was prepared, Rosefielde had called Jerry Price, C.P.A., to inquire as to the tax consequences of Lattuga’s interest upon transfer. Kaye testified that at the time, he did not know about this call between Rosefielde and Price.\nThe final agreement assigned Lattuga’s 10 percent interest to one of Rosefielde’s corporations, not to La Sammana. Rosefielde testified that both Wolfe and Kaye were aware of this arrangement, Kaye testified that he did not learn about the assignment until late 2004 or early 2005; Wolfe corroborated Kaye’s testimony in this respect. On July 11 and 16, 2004, Kaye and the Lattugas, (Joseph and his wife), signed the agreement; Rosefielde thereafter accepted the interest in La Sammana without paying any kind of consideration or purchase price.\nJoseph Lattuga testified that Rosefielde represented him in other unrelated matters through 2004. Rosefielde claimed, however, that in the negotiation leading to Lattuga’s separation, he was only representing Flagship and Atlantic Palace and was no longer performing any work for Lattuga and his wife. Despite this, Lattuga testified that Rosefielde never advised him about this apparent conflict of interest nor suggested to him to have an independent attorney review the employment separation agreement. In fact, Rosefielde encouraged Lattuga to accept the separation offer and told him that Kaye did not want to speak to him. This ultimately degenerated into a “he said versus he said” scenario. Kaye testified that Rosefielde was instrumental in the decision to terminate Lattuga. Rosefielde denied that he instigated Kaye to terminate Lattuga and claimed that he encouraged Kaye to work out the problems with Lattuga.\nRosefielde prepared a business plan for La Sammana that described the renovation of the property and the financing arrangement for sales of the timeshare units. He recommended the formation of “La Sammana Management,” to oversee hotel operations, collect condominium fees, pay condominium expenses, and market and rent condominium units for individual unit owners. Both Kaye and Valenti, the CFO for Atlantic Palace and Flagship, testified that they believed that the proposed new management entity was not necessary and would needlessly duplicate expenses.\nConsistent with the highly contentious nature of this litigation, Rosefielde and Kaye have diametrically different recollections as to how La Sammana Management was formed and the role each man played in its formation. Rosefielde testified that Kaye was represented by Wolfe in this matter and received the benefit of his independent review and ultimate legal opinion as to the content of the management agreement.\nAs means of emphasizing, or as defendants may reasonably argue melodramatizing the measure of Kaye’s conviction on this subject, plaintiffs’ trial counsel asked Kaye to look directly at Judge Nugent as he testified that there was not a “shred of truth” in Rosefielde’s claim that Wolfe represented him in connection with the creation of La Sammana Management. Rosefielde sent Kaye an email dated February 24, 2003, setting forth some of the details of the agreement, which included a list of the entities and individuals that held an ownership interest in the company.\nIn exchange for a $1000 contribution, Rose Associates, one of Rosefielde’s entities, would receive 15 percent of any distributions made to become a member of La Sammana Management. The agreement named Rosefielde as general manager and included a 10 percent profit-interest to himself, “off the top,” as general manager. This gave Rosefielde a 25 percent distribution interest of the company’s revenues. Although Kaye also received a 25 percent distribution interest, his net share was actually less than Rosefielde’s, because the general manager’s 10 percent profit-interest was derived from gross revenues. Kaye testified that he discovered this covert disparity in distribution benefits after the attorney representing him in this litigation brought it to his attention.\nRosefielde’s original February 24, 2003 memorandum proposing the creation of the management company did not list a salary for the general manager position. Kaye testified that notations on the second copy of the document show that Rosefielde told him that a salary for the general manager was necessary. Rosefielde originally asked for 10 percent; Kaye testified that they agreed to settle on 5 percent. However, as has been previously noted, the final agreement reflected Rosefieldeâs compensation as general manager to be 10 percent of gross revenues.\nValenti, Tunney, Wolfe, and Rosefielde signed the agreement. In December 2003, after the creation of La Sammana Management, Kaye paid Rosefielde a discretionary bonus of $20,000. In January 2005, Rosefielde hired an expert to prepare a preliminary valuation report as to the value of his ownership interest in La Sammana Management. Based on this report, Rosefielde told Kaye that he would be willing to be âbought out” of La Sammana Management for $72,000.\nB\nBA MANAGEMENT\nAccording to Rosefielde, in September 2004, Kaye asked him to prepare an operating agreement for a new entity to be known as “BA Management,” for the purpose of managing the sales at La Sammana. Dated September 7, 2004, the seventeen-page operating agreement Rosefielde prepared reflects a 60 percent ownership interest held by a trust controlled by Kaye; 20 percent ownership interest by Kaye’s son, Jason; and the final 20 percent ownership interest by Rose Associates, an entity owned by Rose-fielde. Although Rosefielde testified that the agreement was intended to apply only to sales in Brigantine at La Sammana, the agreement, on its face, provides that it “will manage the sale of timeshare units throughout the world.”\nOnce again, despite taking the time to memorialize many of the formative details of the company, the parties’ perception and recollection of what actually took place are strikingly different. Kaye testified that he signed the agreement under false pretenses, based on Rosefielde’s claim that it had something to do with the trusts for his children. Kaye described the circumstances as follows:\nA. I was with Jason, I was getting ready to go back to Miami, he had a conference table in his office and I walked in to say goodbye to everybody, and he says wait, I have something for you to sign for the kids’ trust. So he gave me the signature page, I signed, and then he said and Jason has to sign also. And Jason asked me well, what is this, Dad. I said don’t worry, it’s for the trust, just sign it. And Jason signed it and we left.\n[KAYE’S COUNSEL]: Was [Rosefielde], at that point, functioning as a tax attorney overseeing the trust?\nA. Absolutely.\nAccording to Kaye, Rosefielde never disclosed the existence of BA Management to him; the first time he discovered its existence was in January 2005, after Rosefielde’s termination.\nBA Management’s operating agreement provided for a 10 percent management fee to be applied against projected sales of $50,000,000; Thus, Rosefielde’s 20 percent share of the projected fees amounted to $1,000,000.\nC\nMISCELLANEOUS MALFEASANCE\nFlagship’s finance manager, Geovanny LoPresti, testified that by 2003, many timeshare unit owners had defaulted on their obligation to pay installment payments on the original purchase price as well as a variety of other general fees. In lieu of instituting formal foreclosure proceedings that would be both costly and time consuming, Rosefielde decided to have LoPresti forge quitclaim deeds to be recorded as a settlement of the outstanding claims. According to LoPresti, Rosefielde’s intention was to make this inventory of timeshare units available once again for remarketing. LoPresti testified that Rosefielde offered him compensation for each deed. According to LoPresti, when he refused to go along with this scheme, Rosefielde harassed, pursued, and intimidated him. When this proved ineffective, Rose-fielde threatened to fire him if he did not forge the deeds.\nRosefielde denied instructing LoPresti or anyone else to forge deeds. According to Rosefielde, Kaye complained to him that LoPresti no longer wanted to forge deeds. Rosefielde then advised Kaye not to get involved in illegal activity.\nRobert Glass, who had worked with LoPresti at Flagship, testified that, by June 2003, he told Rosefielde that he suspected that Michael Hogan, who also worked in the same office at Flagship, may have been forging quitclaim deeds; Hogan was turning in a “disproportionate amount” of quitclaim deeds as compared to Glass. In addition, timeshares owned by people from different states had their signatures notarized in their respective quitclaim deed on the same day and by the same notary, who was also Hogan’s girlfriend.\nGlass testified that Rosefielde never told him to forge deeds. Although Hogan at first denied that Rosefielde directed him to forge deeds, he admitted that at one point Rosefielde had offered him $300 for each forged deed; he ultimately opted to exercise his right against self-incrimination and refused to answer any more questions on this subject. In an email dated September 5, 2003, Valenti informed Rosefielde that he had learned from another source that Hogan was forging deeds. Valenti testified that Rosefielde established a protocol through which questionable deeds would be passed up through the ranks, with Rosefielde being the final arbiter.\nIn February 2004, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) started investigating Flagship and Atlantic Palace for violations of the “Do Not Call” regulations, a consumer protection law designed to stop telemarketers from calling people; violations carry the potential for the imposition of large fines that could have bankrupted all of Kaye’s companies. The FTC initially proposed a fine of $7.2 million. Rosefielde successfully negotiated with the FTC to reduce the fine to $500,000. Kaye was extremely pleased with the result.\nKaye directed Flagship’s outside accounting firm to prepare amended tax returns for Flagship and Atlantic Palace for 2003 that reversed special treatment for interval sales that had dramatically reduced the companiesâ cash positions. When Rosefielde learned of Kaye’s instructions, he immediately objected to the amendments because they would have rendered false the representations he had made to the FTC about the companies’ finances to induce the agency to settle the “do-not-call” penalties for only $500,000. According to Rosefielde, he made this issue clear to Kaye.\nD\nINSURANCE\nAt all times relevant to this ease, Frank Siracusa was an insurance broker in Atlantic City. Kaye’s companies used Siracusa for all of their insurance needs. Siracusa was also Kaye’s friend, and the two had similar political affiliations, especially those involving regional and municipal politics. According to plaintiffs, Rosefielde concocted a scheme to profit from Kaye’s insurance needs by suggesting, as a cost-saving measure, that Kaye allow another insurance broker to bid for the same coverage provided by Siracusa.\nRosefielde selected the Webster Insurance Agency (Webster) in Connecticut as the broker to compete with Siracusa for Kaye’s insurance needs. Unbeknownst to plaintiffs, Webster was owned by Rosefielde’s niece, Wendy Newman. Ostensibly based on a lower bid for comparable coverage, Rosefielde awarded Webster the right to provide insurance coverage for all of Kayeâs businesses, with the exception of Atlantic Palace, which had its own independent condominium association board of directors. The Atlantic Palace board decided to continue its business association with Siracusa.\nKaye testified that, when he initially discovered Rosefielde’s subterfuge, he wanted to switch back to Siracusa immediately. However, â[sjomebody from [his] officeâ told him that he would be subject to a $150,000 penalty from Webster if he changed agencies at that point. Kaye switched the accounts back to Siracusa after one year.\nIn connection with his decision to return to Siracusa, Kaye was asked about threats allegedly made by a Siracusa employee named Ed Donicolatino, a/k/a Ed Donic, who was also active in Atlantic City municipal politics. Specifically, Donic had allegedly threatened that he would arrange to increase the municipal tax assessments of Kaye’s properties unless Kaye remained with Siracusa. Kaye and Valenti, CFO for Atlantic Palace and Flagship, both denied being threatened in any manner by Siracusa or anyone associated with him.\nE\nParadise Global Realty\nRosefielde created a wholly owned entity known as Paradise Global Realty (Paradise) to procure group health insurance coverage for the individuals who sold timeshares, whom Rosefielde characterized as independent contractors. Lisa Trefankjian, who at the time of trial was employed as Flagship’s guest services resort manager, testified that Rosefielde immediately encountered a coverage problem with his plan. In order to obtain group health coverage, the timeshare sellers needed to be employees of Paradise and work a minimum number of hours. However, Paradise was merely a paper entity that did not have any employees.\nAccording to Trefankjian, to overcome this problem, Rosefielde directed her to complete and sign an Aetna insurance application misrepresenting that the timeshare sellers were employees of Paradise. Trefankjian also testified that Rosefielde signed a section in the Aetna application intended to be completed by the “CPA or attorney” for the group. At Rosefielde’s direction, Trefankjian also created letterhead stationery for Paradise. Using the phony Paradise letterhead, Trefankjian sent a letter to Aetna confirming that “[a]ll sales staff works exclusively for Paradise on a full-time basis.”\nRosefielde also drafted a brokerage agreement between Paradise and La Sammana, authorizing Paradise to sell La Sammana timeshares. The brokerage agreement was intended to protect La Sammana from liability for acts performed by the sales staff. Emblematic of the problems the trial court encountered in this case, Rosefielde’s testimony in this area can fairly be characterized as murky. He claimed to have no recollection of drafting the agreement, but did not deny that he could have done so. Rose-fielde intended for Paradise to contribute 40 percent of the cost of health insurance coverage for the sales staff. He claimed that he told Kaye about the agreement; Kaye denied that Rosefielde ever told him about this scheme to, in essence, commit insurance fraud.\nAs CFO for Atlantic Palace and Flagship, Valenti also denied that Rosefielde raised any questions with him concerning insurance coverage for the sales staff or discussed what he (Rosefielde) had done with Paradise. Valenti testified that when he looked at the paperwork, he immediately determined that the insurance coverage for the sales staff had been obtained based on false information and cancelled the policy. Valenti thereafter obtained individual policies for the independent contractors who wanted insurance.\nF\nMISAPPROPRIATIONS\nPlaintiffs called John Ibone, the director of sales for Atlantic Palace and Flagship, as their principal witness to present evidence of Rosefielde’s prodigal expenditures on so-called business-related matters. In his direct examination, Ibone testified that, three months after Rosefielde began working as COO and general counsel, he gave Ibone a “substantial raise” in salary. When asked to define what he meant by “substantial,” Ibone clarified that it was “a little over” $100,000.\nCommencing in 2003, Ibone testified that Rosefielde began asking him to report to his office at the end of the workday, around five o’clock in the afternoon, to talk about matters in general while consuming one to two bottles of wine. As explained by Ibone, these social parleys occurred in Rosefieldeâs office and on a frequent basis: “[SJeventy percent of the time that he was here, so if it was five days [one workweek] it would be three-and-a-half days.â Those days were also in succession. According to Ibone, before Rosefielde’s arrival, he had never had this kind of social interaction with the second highest official in the Kaye companies.\nIbone also testified that he felt pressured to attend these semi-daily wine-drinking sessions with Rosefielde:\n[T]here were many times that, you know, I would have preferred — I just had a newborn baby and built a house that same year, so I would have probably preferred to go home, but I chose to — to go because of ... I don’t know of the proper word but I guess the word is probably a little bit of fear, little bit of— [Kosefieldel has a way of presenting himself____\n[M]y perception of it was if I didn’t do it, I may be like looked at differently. And there were other situations that it happened so I felt, you know, that I had to do that for the position that I was in.\nIn addition to these social gatherings at Rosefielde’s office, soon a “pattern developed,” involving the same kind of non-business-related gatherings, but in a more extravagant venue. Rosefielde and Ibone began dining four times a week at a restaurant located inside the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. In fact, Ibone testified that they dined there most of the time when Rosefielde was in town. This continued, according to Ibone, for “at least six months.” Again, Ibone characterized these events as “social dinners”; Rosefielde “always paid for everything with his personal credit card.” When asked by plaintiffs’ counsel if Rose- fielde always paid with his personal credit card, Ibone responded: “Every time I[saw] the credit card it was personal — I’m not even sure if he had a corporate card to be honest with you.”\nG\nTHE TRIP TO LAS VEGAS\nIn March 2004, Ibone wanted to reward the productivity of the sales staff. He thus arranged to have Flagship’s top four leaders in sales fly to Las Vegas, Nevada, and stay at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (MGM Grand) for three nights, all expenses paid by Flagship. As director of sales, Ibone included himself as a participant. The five men shared a regular room at the MGM Grand; in Ibone’s words, the men “bunked together.” Although Ibone discussed the trip with Rosefielde, the latter was not included in the arrangements. Ibone did not expect Rosefielde would join them in Las Vegas or otherwise participate in the trip in any manner.\nRosefielde decided differently and flew separately to Las Vegas to join Ibone and the sales team. However, instead of staying at the MGM Grand, Rosefielde booked a penthouse suite at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino (Bellagio), significantly more expensive accommodations as compared with the MGM Grand. According to Ibone, either on the first or second day of the trip, Rosefielde invited him and the four sales-persons to join him for dinner at a steakhouse located in the Bellagio.\nWhen Ibone and the sales team arrived at the steakhouse, they were joined by Rosefielde and “three young ladies” whose names Ibone could not recall. Rosefielde introduced the three women as his âfriends.” They joined the six men for dinner, which Rose-fielde paid for with his personal credit card. Again, Ibone testi- fled that he assumed it was Rosefielde’s personal credit card. However, plaintiffs produced evidence that Flagship paid $4000 for Rosefielde’s stay at the Bellagio.\nAfter dinner, Rosefielde, Ibone, the four members of the sales team, and the three women went back to Rosefielde’s penthouse suite. Ibone described what he experienced next as follows:\nI felt like I was watching a movie — a beautiful, unbelievable penthouse on the top of the Bellagio which we went up to and opened up to a grand piano and just skylights all over the city, you can see it all opened up with windows. It was unbelievable] — it was, it was bigger than my house. It was beautiful.\nRosefielde invited the five men to “have a drink” and “socialize.” They stayed for approximately three hours. Ibone testified that the following occurred during this time period:\n[T]he girls did, I guess — I don’t know, what you would call it — a show together, you know, nothing on, nude show, did things to each other, that kind of stuff, and that all happened, and then the three of them went into, just to make it short, three of them went into [Rosefielde’s] room and we left.\nRosefielde testified that he did not recall the details of the dinner or very much about the trip. He believed it was a legitimate business expense and that other managers were aware that he had joined the trip.\nH\nSEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nSusan Tunney, Flagship’s former vice president of operations, was forty-one years old, married, and had two children at the time of trial. She was one of two female employees at Flagship who testified against Rosefielde, alleging inappropriate sexual conduct.\nTunney alleged that Rosefielde inappropriately hugged her and kissed her on the lips each morning. These acts were unwel-comed by her and she made her feelings known to Rosefielde using clear, unequivocal language. Despite her protestations, Rosefielde continued to engage in this conduct, which made her feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable. Rosefielde also had “pornographic images” as screensavers on his work desk computer.\nTunney also testified about a particular incident in which she and Rosefielde were driving back from a business dinner in Philadelphia. They were the only people in the car. While Tunney drove, Rosefielde “put his hand on [her] knee and ran it up [her] thigh.” She was wearing a skirt. He stopped after Tunney told him to stop. When asked if Rosefielde ever apologized, Tunney responded: “He never acknowledged it.” According to Tunney, that was not the first time that Rosefielde had touched her in a sexually inappropriate manner. He habitually hugged her and placed his hand on her knee.\nRosefielde admitted that he greeted Tunney with hugs and kisses, but denied ever placing his hand on her thigh or behaving inappropriately. Tunney admitted that she never told Rosefielde she was offended by his greetings or requested that he stop. Tunney did not file a sexual harassment claim against Rosefielde during her tenure at Flagship.\nDanielle Leonardis was the other woman employee at Flagship to testify against Rosefielde concerning sexually inappropriate behavior. Leonardis was a bartender employed at the Ozone Restaurant located inside the Flagship. She testified that Rose-fielde often came to the bar to drink wine, arranged for her promotion, and gave her very large tips, dinners at other restaurants, invitations to shows, and an inappropriate gift of silk pajamas. Rosefielde testified that he had no recollection of buying Leonardis silk pajamas.\nLeonardis testified that Rosefielde’s unwelcomed attention made her very uncomfortable. She ultimately resigned from her job at Flagship, claiming that Rosefielde’s conduct caused needless tension in her relationship with her boyfriend; she was also disturbed by rumors that she and Rosefielde had had a clandes tine sexual relationship. As was the case with Tunney, however, Leonardis never filed a sexual harassment complaint against Rosefielde.\nI\nROSEFIELDE’S TERMINATION\nOn January 13, 2005, Kaye terminated Rosefielde’s employment as general counsel and COO. He told Rosefielde that they had different business philosophies and should not work together on a full-time basis. Despite this, Kaye initially wanted Rosefielde to remain as a consultant, primarily so he would be available as a witness in another court case.\nIV\nTHE LEGAL MALPRACTICE ACTION\nCounts one, two, and three of plaintiffs’ original complaint included the term “legal malpractice” among two other theories of liability against Rosefielde. These three counts were principally predicated on allegations of fraud and breach of fiduciary duties by Rosefielde in his role as COO and general counsel. By contrast, count four identified “legal malpractice” as the exclusive basis for recovery based on the following allegations:\n29. In the discharge of his responsibilities as legal counsel to plaintiffs Kaye/Entities, defendant Alan P. Rosefielde was responsible to assume compliance by all plaintiffs Kaye/Entities with local, State and Federal law and regulations. This includes 15 United States Code Annotated 1601, commonly known as the “Do not call law”. Defendant Alan P. Rosefielde was specifically instructed by one or more of plaintiffs Kaye/Entities to install all necessary computer software to place plaintiffs Kaye/Entities into compliance with the law. Rather than follow those instructions, he disregarded them, by claiming that the cost was too high and the risk acceptable.\n30. As a direct and proximate cause of his dereliction, plaintiffs Kaye/Entities were investigated and prosecuted by the Federal Trade Commission, the result being a $500,000.00 fine and legal fees and costs approximating $200,000.00. All of this was directly occasioned by the negligent legal representation provided by defendant Alan P. Rosefielde.\nPlaintiffs called attorney Carl Poplar as an expert on the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), legal malpractice, and attorney ethics. Poplar opined that Rosefielde violated RPC 1.7(a) and RPC 1.8, ethical rules prohibiting an attorney from engaging in conduct that creates a conflict of interest between the attorney and the client. Specifically, Poplar opined that Rosefielde violated these rules when he: (1) served as an attorney for the Lattugas; (2) took advantage of his position as general counsel to obtain an interests in La Sammana Management and La Sammana Ventures; and (3) drafted the BA Management agreement.\nAccording to Poplar, under RPC 5.5(b)(2), an attorney is permitted to function as in-house counsel for a New Jersey company without being admitted to practice law in New Jersey, as long as he or she complies with the registration requirements of Rule 1:27-2, remains in good standing in other states, and certifies compliance with certain other laws, rules, and regulations.\nPoplar testified that although Rosefielde could function as in-house in 2003, he was not authorized to prosecute or defend a case or otherwise appear in a New Jersey courtroom as the legal representative of a person or legal entity. According to Poplar, by Rosefielde’s own admission he was not in compliance with the requirements of Rule 1:27-2 as of January 1, 2004. Rosefielde had not been admitted to practice law in New Jersey and had not registered with the New Jersey Supreme Court as an out-of-state attorney functioning as in-house counsel.\nBased on his review of the record, Poplar concluded that Rosefielde had an attorney-client relationship with Flagship, Atlantic Palace, La Sammana, Kaye, the Lattugas, and JFL Ventures. Poplar testified that Rosefielde acknowledged to him that he was the attorney for Flagship, Atlantic Palace, and La Samma-na. Kaye also believed and considered Rosefielde to be the legal representative and counsel for these entities. In Poplar’s opinion, “the reasonable perception of a client ... not the self-serving intention of the attorney” controls.\nAfter reviewing “the documentation and testimony of the topic,” Poplar testified that, commencing in 2002 until the time of trial, Rosefielde had an attorney/client relationship with the Lattugas. Rosefielde gave them advice on tax matters and was paid a retainer of $800 per month. Rosefielde was the registered agent for JPL Ventures and prepared and filed the incorporation documents as an attorney. In Poplar’s opinion, an attorney who incorporates a business entity performs a legal service for the client.\nRPC 1.7(a) prohibits an attorney from representing a client if the representation of the client will be “directly adverse” to the interest of another client or if “there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client” or the attorney’s own “personal interest.” Poplar testified that Rosefielde should not have represented the Lattugas as their personal lawyer while he was also serving as general counsel to Joseph Lattuga’s employer, as well as Kaye and his business entities. Poplar explained as follows:\nMr. Kaye perceived Mr. Rosefielde as his attorney and the Lattugas perceived Mr. Rosefielde’s activity as attorney, and I viewed his, Mr. Rosefielde’s activity as attorney representing each side in this transaction, and this was a transaction involving a substantial amount of money and it was a transaction in which both sides had economic interest.\nPoplar saw nothing in the record that would have satisfied the disclosure requirements under RPC 1.7(b), permitting a possible waiver by the clients of the attorney’s conflict of interest. Poplar also rejected as “fallacious” any attempt by Rosefielde to exempt himself from his ethical obligations as an attorney by suggesting that, at the time he prepared Lattuga’s separation agreement from Kaye, he was acting within his dual role as COO. Finally, Poplar noted that Rosefielde’s acquisition of a 10 percent ownership interest in La Sammana may have also violated federal and state criminal laws.\nAlthough Judge Nugent struck Poplar’s testimony referring to any possible criminal culpability, he allowed counsel to elicit from Poplar an opinion on the standard used to determine the civil implications of attorney theft of a client’s property. Poplar testified that, in a transaction like the one at issue, an attorney has a duty of fidelity, loyalty, and good faith in dealing with an employer. According to Poplar, lawyers who also function as an employee of the client have a duty not to misappropriate a client’s property or take anything belonging to the client/employer. Like any other employee, a lawyer has a general duty of good faith and fair dealing in his or her dealings with his or her employer.\nIn Poplar’s opinion, Rosefielde violated this duty of good faith and fair dealing by spending thousands of dollars in nonbusiness-related activities, such as the consumption of high-end wines, charges for a personal gym trainer, and personal travel between New Jersey and Florida. By contrast and notable irony, Rose-fielde closely scrutinized employees’ applications for reimbursement and often rejected expense vouchers submitted by subordinate employees. In a policy statement prepared by Rosefielde himself, subordinate employees were required to submit vouchers with specificity. Employees seeking reimbursement of or authorization for entertainment and meal expenses were to comply with IRS guidelines. Any reimbursed expenses that were thereafter deemed unreasonable would be imputed as income and taxed accordingly.\nPoplar testified that the operating agreement Rosefielde drafted in March 2003 for La Sammana Management was intended “to create a management system for the ... Brigantine property.” Although Rosefielde viewed drafting this document as part of his responsibilities as COO, Poplar opined that when a lawyer drafts a legal document, he or she is acting as an attorney, notwithstanding any other title or relationship he or she may have had at the time with the client.\nGiven the conflict of interest restrictions in RPC 1.8(a), Poplar found troubling that the agreement Rosefielde drafted provided for him to receive compensation for serving as president of La Sammana Management, in the form of 10 percent interest of the company’s gross revenues. Poplar opined that, as an employee and an attorney, Rosefielde was ethically barred from obtaining an interest in a client’s business under RPC 1.8, unless he specifically made the client aware of his or her right to get independent counsel to provide the client with an objective, unbiased assessment of the document at issue.\nPoplar thus opined that Rosefielde committed legal malpractice by: (1) drafting the management agreement; (2) executing the agreement as a representative of a legal entity with a proprietary interest in the business; and (3) obtaining an interest in the business in the form of compensation for management services. Polar also concluded that these actions by Rosefielde also violated his ethical obligations under RPC 1.8.\nPoplar also opined that Rosefielde committed malpractice when he created the BA Management operating agreement. This agreement began with the hubristic goal of deriving profits “throughout the world” from the management of timeshares of Kaye-owned companies. Because the agreement appeared to promote Rosefielde’s self-interest at the expense of his client, Poplar opined that BA Management was tainted by the same conflict of interest problems as La Sammana Management.\nAt the same time Rosefielde was acting as general counsel, Kaye’s personal attorney, and COO of the Atlantic City properties, he prepared the BA Management agreement to provide an ownership distribution interest showing 60 percent to the Bruce Kaye Revocable Trust, 20 percent to Jason Kaye, and 20 percent to Rose Associates. In Poplar’s opinion, Rosefielde’s misconduct in the BA Management documents was more insidious as compared with La Sammana Management, because, at the time he drafted the BA Management agreement, Rosefielde knew Kaye’s mental acuity was significantly compromised by his preoccupation with a recent diagnosis of cancer, which also exacerbated Kaye’s longtime struggle with alcoholism.\nUnder these circumstances, Rosefielde not only had a duty to avoid a conflict of interest under RPC 1.8(a), he also had an ethical duty, and arguably a higher moral responsibility, to take affirmative measures to protect Kaye’s interests in light of his failing cognitive abilities. According to Poplar, under RPC 1.14(b), Rose-fielde had reason to believe that Kaye’s health problems may have impaired his judgment, and diminished his normal cognitive functions and reasoning abilities. Poplar opined that Rosefielde not only violated RPC 1.8(a)(1) and RPC 1.14(b), but also committed legal malpractice by failing to advise Kaye to consult with an independent attorney before signing the BA Management agreement.\nDefendants called attorney Warren W. Faulk as their expert witness on legal malpractice. Faulk opined that Rosefielde did not violate RPC 1.8. According to Faulk, the events that lead to the formation of the BA Management agreement were not a transaction between a lawyer and his client, but a “business venture” engaged in by two “business men.” According to Faulk, even assuming the existence at the time of an attorney-client relationship between Rosefielde and Kaye, “there was no damage [and] no proximate cause.”\nWith respect to La Sammana Management, Faulk testified that Rosefielde did not commit legal malpractice because none of the individuals involved were his clients. According to Faulk, “it’s pretty clear that [Rosefielde] was acting in a business capacity in this regard as opposed to an attorney.” Defense counsel also asked Faulk to opine as to whether Rosefielde “violated any legal standards in connection with the Lattuga Settlement Agreement and ... the resulted La Sammana Ventures Interests.”\nAccording to Faulk, he was not certain whether the conflict of interest restrictions in RPC 1.8 applied to Rosefielde as in-house counsel. Based on the case law he reviewed, Faulk concluded that RPC 1.8 was intended to apply only “to attorneys in private practice dealing with private clients and entering into the transactions [sic] such as taking a mortgage on their home for purposes of securing a fee in a divorce case.”\nIn Faulk’s view, Rosefielde’s clients in the Lattuga matter were Atlantic Palace and Flagship. Although Rosefielde acquired Lat-tuga’s interest in La Sammana, Faulk believed any potential problems were cured when Rosefielde sent the documents to Kaye’s outside counsel, and made all of the information known to Valenti as the CFO. In fact, Faulk opined that Rosefielde did “probably more than” Rule 1.8 requires.\nV\nJUDGE PERSKIE’S CONDUCT\nA key part of defendants’ argument in this appeal and affirmative claims against plaintiffs involved the question of insurance coverage of Kaye’s entities. As the Court noted in In re Perskie:\nIn essence, the Kaye litigation was a business dispute involving various issues stemming from Mr. Rosefielde’s employment with a time-share business based in Atlantic City, the Flagship Resorts Development Corporation (Flagship), and his eventual termination from Flagship. Mr. Rosefielde maintained that his termination was a result of his recommendation that Flagship end its business relationship with an insurance broker, Frank Siracusa, who according to Rosefielde, allegedly had engaged in improper and questionable business practices. As found in the Presentment, the ACJC concluded that “objective, reasonable and fully informed observers would have sincere doubts about [Judge Perskie’s] impartiality based on Mr. Siracusa’s role in the case and the nature and extent of Respondent’s relationship with Mr. Siracusa.” [207 N.J. at 281, 24 A.3d 277.]\nJudge Perskie acknowledged Ms conflict of interest and accepted the Supreme Court’s conclusion that he violated Canons 1, 2A, and 3C(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Rule 1:12 — 1(f) of the New Jersey Court Rules by failing “to disqualify Mmself from Kaye in accordance with pertinent strictures, and by this conduct, failed to uphold the integrity and independence of the Judiciary and failed to promote public confidence therein.” Id. at 283, 24 A.3d 277 (quoting ACJC findings).\nUnfortunately, Judge Perskie’s involvement and interactions with tMs case did not end at this point. This appeal also requires us to address Judge PersMe’s conduct after the ease was reassigned to Judge Nugent for trial. We again quote from the relevant part of the Court’s decision in In re Perskie:\nCount III of the Formal Complaint charges that Respondent made two appearances in the back of Judge Nugent’s courtroom during the Kaye trial after Respondent had recused himself on his own motion from the case, and that those appearances were “inappropriate and demonstrated or created the appearance that Respondent had an interest in or supported the plaintiffs” case. Respondent admits making the appearances, remaining in Judge Nugent's courtroom for approximately one hour on each occasion, and speaking with one of Mr. Kaye’s attorneys during his second appearance.\nWhile there are factual disputes concerning the exact day of Respondent’s second appearance, who he spoke with on that occasion, and what exactly was discussed, those disputes do not need to be resolved for the purposes of our disposition of Count III. For our purposes, it is sufficient that Respondent not only admits the two uninvited appearances, he also concedes, as pointed out by his attorney in his Post-Hearing Brief, that “he should not have gone into Judge Nugent’s courtroom, or spoken to plaintiff’s counsel, after having recused himself from the [Kaye] case. In these circumstances, that conduct was ill-considered....”!]\nWe could not agree with Respondent more. As we indicated previously, recusal connotes and demands complete separation. By appearing and staying in the back of Judge Nugent’s courtroom to watch the Kaye trial after he had recused himself from the case, Respondent deviated from that demand not once, but twice. In so doing, he created, at a minimum, the unacceptable appearance that he still had an interest in the case. In fact, both Mr. Rosefielde and Mr. Fram [his trial attorney] were impacted by Respondent’s appearances and interpreted those appearances as a show of support for the plaintiffs. Given the history of Respondent’s interface with Kaye, we find their interpretation reasonable and further believe that a reasonable, objective observer might have the same reaction or, at a minimum, question the motivation behind Respondent’s visits. Either way, such questions demonstrate the impropriety of Respondent’s conduct under the Code of Judicial Conduct The mandate, expected of all judicial officers, to maintain and uphold the integrity and independence of the Judiciary is sacrosanct and without limit. See Canons 1 and 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. By personally appearing and observing the trial of a ease from which he was recused on two separate occasions, Respondent allowed that integrity and independence to be called into question and, consequently, flouted his judicial obligations and responsibilities. As a result of this finding, we further conclude that Respondent’s conduct violated Canons 1, 2A and 2B of the Code of Judicial Conduct\n[Id. at 283-84, 24 A.3d 277 (alterations in original) (quoting ACJC decision).]\nDefendants emphasized that Judge Perskie actively managed this case and decided a number of pretrial motions during the one-year period before he finally recused himself. According to defendants, during this time period, Judge Perskie repeatedly ruled in plaintiffs’ favor “on important motions that defined the issues to be tried and how those issues would be tried.” Defendants maintain that Judge Perskie “compounded his error by forcing Rosefielde’s counsel to file a formal motion for recusal, by denying that motion, and by leveling unjustified criticisms at Rosefielde’s counsel.” However, defendants do not cite to specific parts of the record to support these generalized allegations or present any details of what they consider to be unjustified.\nDefendants also claim that upon disqualification, Judge Perskie should have followed the requirements of Rule 1:12 — 3(a), which provides, in relevant part as follows:\nIn the event of the disqualification or inability for any reason of a judge to hear any pending matter before or after trial, another judge of the court in which the matter is pending or a judge temporarily assigned to hear the matter shall be designated by the Chief Justice or by the Assignment Judge of the county where the matter is pending____\nFinally, defendants claim that Judge Perskie’s appearances in court during the trial presided over by Judge Nugent improperly conveyed to Judge Nugent that Judge Perskie had an ongoing interest in the outcome of the case.\nWe do not discern any connection between Judge Perskie’s conduct, either before or after his recusal, and the factual findings and legal conclusions reached by Judge Nugent. There is absolutely no evidence that Judge Perskie’s ill-advised decision to visit the trial while in progress before Judge Nugent, and at one point approach and speak to plaintiffs’ counsel, in any way affected the impartiality of the proceedings presided over by Judge Nugent. Any suggestion or innuendo impugning the integrity of the proceedings presided over by Judge Nugent is not supported by the record. We therefore categorically reject any implication suggesting otherwise.\nThere is also no evidence or basis to question Judge Nugent’s ability as the fact-finder to review Siracusa’s testimony fairly and impartially. Whatever taint Siracusa’s relationship with Judge Perskie may have had on the fairness of these proceedings was completely purged by Judge Nugent’s unquestioned impartiality. This trial was decided on the merits of the parties’ case. Our role as an intermediate appellate court is to review the rulings of the trial court. Any disagreement we may have with any of Judge Nugent’s rulings is based entirely on our views of the legal principles involved.\nVI\nTHE DOCTRINE OF ACILLARY JURISDICTION\nPlaintiffs’ original complaint filed in the Chancery Division was grounded on three interrelated theories of liability: breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, and civil fraud. In determining whether a cause of action is predicated on equitable or legal grounds, the remedy sought by the parties “remains the most persuasive factor.” Weinisch v. Sawyer, 123 N.J. 333, 344, 587 A.2d 615 (1991) (citing Shaner v. Horizon Bankcorp., 116 N.J. 433, 450-51, 561 A.2d 1130 (1989)). Here, plaintiffs sought the following primary forms of relief:\nA. An Order rescinding and rendering null and void the July 9, 2004 document captioned “Assignment of Member’s Interest in La Sammana Ventures, LLC” executed by Joseph Lattuga, President of J.F.L. Ventures, Inc. in favor of defendants Rose Associates, Inc. of Miami and Alan P. Rosefielde, President.\nB. Rescinding and rendering null and void those portions of the May 1, 2003 document captioned “Operating Agreement of La Sammana Management, LLC” insofar as they refer to or award to defendant Alan P. Rosefielde or defendant Rose Associates, Inc. of Miami any title, appointment as General Manager or otherwise, designation as Chief Executive Officer and President or otherwise, fees and out of pocket expenses, membership interests or entitlement to distributions or, in the alternative, so reforming the Agreement.\nC. Disgorgement and return of all payments, profits, disbursements and other funds received by any defendant pursuant to those documents.\nD. Rescinding and rendering null and void the entirety of the document captioned “Operating Agreement BA Management, LLC” dated September 7, 2004.\nE. Unjoining and restraining defendants Alan P. Rosefielde, Rose Associates, Inc. of Miami, and Plumrose Company, Inc. from acting in the interest of or on behalf of and from representing themselves as members, agents or representatives of all plaintiffs Kaye/Entities and defendant La Sammana Management, LLC and defendant BA Management, LLC.\nF. Compensatory damages including, but not limited to, the full amount of the FTC fine and all associated legal fees and costs and for all non-business expenses fraudulently extracted from plaintiffs Kaye/Entities.\n[ (Emphasis added).]\nExcept for the demand of compensatory damages, all of the other forms of relief sought by plaintiffs are inherently equitable in nature. We are thus satisfied that the complaint was properly filed in and accepted by the Chancery Division. R. 4:3-l(a)(l).\nRosefielde argues that Judge Nugent erred when he denied his motion to transfer his statutory cause of action under CEPA and common law claim of breach of contract to the Law Division for a jury trial. According to Rosefielde, despite his status as COO and general counsel, he functioned as Kaye’s employee and was entitled to prosecute his CEPA action before a jury as the Legislature provided under N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. He also argues that Art I, Paragraph 9 of the New Jersey Constitution guarantees him the right to a jury trial on his common law claim that Kaye violated an oral contract.\nJudge Nugent rejected these arguments and denied Rosefielde’s motion to bifurcate the proceedings before him and transfer these two discrete claims to the Law Division for trial before a jury. Judge Nugent explained Ms ruling in a memorandum of opimon dated April 5, 2007. He framed the issues before Mm as follows:\nThe Defendants ... bring this motion seeking an order severing the equitable claims recited in the first three counts [ ] of the Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint (\"the Complaint”) for trial in the Chancery Division where this action was filed and remains pending, and transferring the legal claims recited in Counts Four, Five, and Seven’ of the Complaint to the Law Division for a jury trial. Count Six of the Complaint has been dismissed.[ ] Alternatively, the Defendants request that the court allow a jury trial on all legal claims recited in the Complaint, in the Defendants’ counterclaim, and in the Defendants’ third-party complaint.[ ] The Defendants argue that with the exception of the first three counts of the plaintiffs’ complaint, the plaintiffs’ claims are legal, not equitable, and the court does not have ancillary jurisdiction over the legal claims because they are not “incidental or essential” to the determination of the equitable issues.\nRelying primarily on our Supreme Court’s holding in Lyn-Anna, supra, Judge Nugent demed defendants’ motion. After reviewing defendants’ contentions in their counterclaim and canvassing the relevant eases that have addressed this question, Judge Nugent reached the following conclusion:\nThe thread that weaves through and binds together the issues and claims in the Complaint and Counterclaim is the fiduciary relationship between and among the parties. Rosefielde, in his capacity as a lawyer, owed fiduciary duties to the entities and individuals who relied upon his legal expertise. In his capacity as Chief Operating Officer of the Kaye entities, he owed fiduciary duties to the business entities he operated. Rosefielde’s alleged breach of his fiduciary duties underpins the plaintiffs’ equitable and legal claims, including their claims that he committed legal malpractice when he acquired ownership and monetary interests in the LLCs (Counts One through Three of the Complaint), when he exposed Kaye entities to substantial FCC fines (Count Four) and when he instituted the system that enabled him to inflate and falsify his business expenses (Count Five). The plaintiffs allege explicitly that [Rosefielde] breached his fiduciary duties, committed fraud, and was an unfaithful servant when he allegedly aided the Kaye entities’ competitors and committed a laundry list of acts of misfeasance during his tenure as General Counsel and Chief Operating Officer (Count Seven).\nAlthough defendant Rosefielde’s CEPA and Breach of Contract claims are legal in nature and are claims for monetary damages, the plaintiffs’ proofs on their equitable claims will also be offered in defense of Rosefielde’s CEPA and Breach of Contract claims. In that regard, the plaintiffs represent that they intend to call at trial nine witnesses who will testify on the majority of issues raised in the Complaint and Counterclaim. One witness, the plaintiffs legal malpractice expert, will give testimony about Rosefielde’s alleged malpractice with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ claims.\nThe core of the controversy in the instant action centers on the fiduciary relationship among the parties, just as it did in Lyn-Anna Properties. The equitable and legal claims of the parties and the overlapping proofs are so interrelated and intertwined that the legal claims are properly deemed ancillary to the equitable claims.\nGiven Judge Nugent’s reliance on Lyn-Anna, we will begin our analysis by summarizing the salient facts confronted by the Supreme Court in that case. The question in Lyn-Anna concerned “whether in a pending equitable action between business partners, the Chancery Division may retain jurisdiction over a compulsory counterclaim asserted by one group of partners against another group of partners for legal malpractice related to the partnership affairs.” 145 N.J. at 315, 678 A.2d 683.\nThe controversy in Lyn-Anna “arose out of a failed real estate development project” to construct a ninety-six-unit condominium complex in North Miami Beach, Florida. Id. at 315-16, 678 A.2d 683. The project was originally intended to be a joint venture between Lyn-Anna Properties (Lyn-Anna), a limited partnership owned by plaintiffs Alan Husack and attorney Alan Kipnis, and Harborview Development Corporation (Harborview), “a real estate development corporation owned by” Robert Notte. Id. at 316, 678 A.2d 683.\nThe project was financially troubled from its inception. The bank the parties found to finance the construction became insolvent in 1986, and the parties were forced to secure alternative financing from another bank. Ibid. When additional funds became necessary, Notte brought in his “acquaintance,” Phillip Kurens, who, in December 1987, agreed to provide the needed cash in the form of an investment in the project and a share of the profits once it was completed. Ibid. Kurens formed Kurens South, Inc., and became a partner with Harborview. He alleged, however, that Kipnis “acted as attorney for Harborview in that matter, and served as escrow agent for the receipt of Kurens’[s] money.” Ibid.\nDespite this infusion of funds from Kurens in late 1987, the project’s financial stability proved to be short lived. By the end of 1989, the project was losing money and in need of more funds to survive. Ibid. Kurens again agreed to help. This time, however, Kurens wanted a greater ownership interest and operational control of the project. Ibid. “On December 12, 1989, Kurens and Harborview entered into an agreement” giving Kurens all of Notte’s interest in Harborview and “managerial control” of the project. As a result, Lyn-Anna and Kurens became partners. Ibid.\nAlthough the construction project was located in Florida, all of the financial dealings and management decisions occurred in Essex County, New Jersey. Ibid. Thus, when the project finally failed in December 1990, Lyn-Anna filed suit in the Chancery Division, Essex County “seeking to restrain the disbursement of funds and to obtain an accounting of monies disbursed.” Ibid. The plaintiffs accused Kurens of breaching a December 12, 1989 management agreement after he assumed control of Harborview, which, according to the plaintiffs, lead to the financial downfall of the project. Id. at 317, 678 A.2d 683.\nKurens, the two corporate entities involved (Kurens South, Inc., and Harborview), and Claire Kurens (presumably his wife) filed a counterclaim seeking compensatory damages in the form of financial losses associated with the venture. The defendants’ counterclaim, however, “focused on events that occurred between the fall of 1987 and December 12, 1989 ... [and] alleged that Kipnis’[s] conduct constituted legal malpractice and fraud.” Ibid.\nAs is the case here, despite having originally and primarily sought equitable relief and causing the joinder of issue in the Chancery Division, all of the parties in Lyn-Anna demanded a trial by jury. Ibid. The plaintiffs waived their jury-demand two years later in 1992. Ibid. Thereafter,\n[presumably to confirm their continued right to a jury trial in the face of plaintiffs’ waiver, defendants then made a motion for a jury trial, which was denied by the trial court in a letter opinion dated February 17,1993. Following a bench trial, the Chancery Division dismissed both plaintiffs’ complaint and defendants’ counterclaim with prejudice.\n[Ibid.]\nOn the defendants’ direct appeal, we affirmed the judgment of the Chancery Division. Ibid. The Supreme Court thereafter granted the defendants’ petition for certification “limited to the issue of whether the defendants are entitled to a jury trial on their counterclaims for malpractice and fraud.” Ibid, (citing 142 N.J. 454, 663 A.2d 1361 (1995)).\nWriting for a unanimous Court, Justice O’Hern began his analysis by discussing our State’s historical roots and discussing in great detail how the right to a trial by jury was treated, recognized, and evolved from the constitutions of 1776 and 1884, to the great revolutionary reforms embedded in our prevailing 1947 Constitution. Id. at 318, 678 A.2d 683. With this historical and legal analysis as backdrop, Justice O’Hern explained how two cases decided one year after the adoption of the 1947 Constitution made clear “that a court of equity may properly adjudicate an ancillary legal claim without providing the complainant with a jury trial.” Id. at 321-22, 678 A.2d 683 (citing Ebling Brewing Co. v. Heirloom, Inc., 1 N.J. 71, 78-79, 61 A.2d 885 (1948) (applying the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction to permit the Chancery Division to adjudicate breach of contract and violations of federal price regulation claims raised in the defendant’s counterclaim demanding a jury trial); and Fleischer v. James Drug Stores, 1 N.J. 138, 150, 62 A.2d 383 (1948) (holding that a plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages, breach of contract, and tortious interference claims in addition to the equitable relief of specific performance is not entitled to a jury trial in the Chancery Division based on the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction)).\nTo illustrate the primacy and scope of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction, Justice O’Hern cited with approval the following passage from Fleischer, written by Justice Heher:\nIt is the settled rule that where equity has rightfully assumed jurisdiction over a cause for any purpose, it may retain the cause for all purposes, and proceed to a final determination of the entire controversy and, except where the jurisdiction of equity depends on the prior establishment of a right at law, settle purely legal rights and grant legal remedies. When the basis of the jurisdiction is once perceived, its scope and extent become readily apparent. The rationale of the rule that an equitable feature draws the cause completely within the cognizance of equity is the policy of avoiding a multiplicity of suits; and so jurisdiction of the whole controversy may be assumed for the doing of complete justice in the one suit. The constitutional right of trial by jury is, of course, subject to this inherent equitable jurisdiction. Equity has a general jurisdiction to adjudicate ancillary and incidental matters. This jurisdiction is co-extensive with the rights of the parties in the subject-matter of the suit. It may, in the exercise of a sound discretion, do whatever is necessary to a final adjudication of the entire controversy between the parties, whether it encompasses an action ex delicto or one ex contractu. And it may grant relief to a defendant or between codefendants. It suffices if the matters to be adjudicated be germane to or grow out of the subject-matter of the equitable jurisdiction.\n[Lyn-Anna, supra, 145 N.J. at 322, 678 A.2d 683 (emphasis added) (quoting Fleischer, supra 1 N.J. at 150, 62 A.2d 383).]\nOne year after Fleischer, and two years removed from the adoption of our 1947 Constitution, the Supreme Court decided Steiner v. Stein, 2 N.J. 367, 66 A.2d 719 (1949). The Court reaffirmed its exhortation to our Chancellors to treat our State’s constitutional right to a trial by jury as subject to the inherent equitable jurisdiction of the Chancery Division in eases “ ‘where equity has rightfully assumed jurisdiction.’ ” 2 N.J. at 374, 66 A.2d 719 (quoting Fleischer, supra, 1 N.J. at 150, 62 A.2d 383).\nJustice O’Hern specifically noted how the salient facts and circumstances of Steiner “were a near mirror-image of the issues” in Lyn-Anna, Lyn-Anna, supra, 145 N.J. at 322, 678 A.2d 683. Applying the principles to the facts in Lyn-Anna, Justice O’Hern concluded that the Chancery Division had correctly applied the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction to deny the defendants’ motion to transfer the legal claims to the Law Division to be decided by a jury. Id. at 332, 678 A.2d 683. Justice O’Hern explained his reasoning as follows:\n[Ajlthough the claims for relief were ultimately limited to money damages, entitlement to relief arose from the fiduciary relationship between and among the parties. Kipnis’fs] duty as an attorney could not be fully divorced from his duty as a prospective partner. So too, Kurens’[s] duties under the contract grew out of his partnership relationship with Kipnis and Husak. The subsequent conduct of Kurens as partner cannot realistically be divorced from the inception of his role in 1987 as a prospective partner of Kipnis and Husak or the expansion of that role in 1989. Notte, the intermediary between Lyn-Anna and Kurens, was the lead-off witness at the trial. Notte invited Kurens to invest in the project after meeting Kurens while Kurens was temporarily employed as a member of Notte’s office staff in New Jersey.... In its ultimate findings of fact, the Chancery Division observed that when Kurens increased his stake in the venture in 1989, he was aware of one of his claims of Kipnis’[s] alleged ethical misconduct in 1987. Kurens had full access to the records that disclosed how the 1987 escrow funds had been handled. In short, there is no clear cut line of demarcation between the attorney malpractice issues and the partnership management issues. The issues are part of the broader fiduciary relationship among the joint ventures in the Harborview project.\n[Id. at 331-32, 678 A.2d 683 (emphasis added).]\nFinally, to dispel any possible doubts as to its continued viability and scope, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the basic tenets of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction by citing, with approval, the words written sixty-five years ago by Justice Heher in Fleischer, supra. Wood v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., 206 N.J. 562, 575, 21 A.3d 1131 (2011); See also Jersey Cent. Power & Light Co. v. Melcar Util. Co., 212 N.J. 576, 589, 59 A.3d 561 (2013) (reaffirming that in determining whether a jury trial is required under our State Constitution, “both the historical basis of the cause of action and the relief sought must be considered.” (citing Steiner, supra, 2 N.J. at 379-80, 66 A.2d 719)).\nArticle I, paragraph 9 of the New Jersey Constitution of 1947 emphatically guarantees the right of trial by jury. “The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate; but the Legislature may authorize the trial of civil causes by a jury of six persons when the matter in dispute does not exceed fifty dollars.” N.J. Const. art. I, K 9. In our view, these words are plain, unambiguous, and provide for no exception. However, when placed in a proper historical context, the Supreme Court has spoken with equal clarity, by consistently upholding the Chancery Division’s power to render the constitutional right of trial by jury “subject ” to its equitable jurisdiction. Although this seems to us as counterintuitive and in derogation of our understanding of the supremacy of the rights secured to our citizens by our State Constitution, as an intermediate appellate court, we are bound to follow and enforce the decisions of the Supreme Court.\nWe thus affirm Judge Nugent’s ruling denying defendants’ motion to transfer the CEPA and breach of contract claims to the Law Division so that they could be decided by a jury. Judge Nugent correctly construed the Supreme Court’s holding in Lyn-Anna and properly applied the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate the entire controversy in a single bench trial.\nVII\nTHE TRIAL COURT’S FACTUAL FINDINGS\nHaving confirmed the Chancery Division’s exercise of jurisdiction, we turn our attention to the trial court’s review of the evidence, the legal principles applied, and the ultimate conclusions reached. Initially, Judge Nugent delivered his decision from the bench on July 9, 2007. Thereafter, he memorialized his decision in a memorandum of opinion dated August 10, 2007. Judge Nugent ruled in favor of plaintiffs on almost every claim that they asserted. He succinctly framed the nature of the dispute as follows:\nThe parties’ factual disputes center on the compensation and conduct of [Rose-fielde] during his two-year tenure as the officer compensated at $500,000 per year to run three timeshare businesses which [Kaye] principally owned or controlled. The parties’ disputes involve nearly every aspect of Rosefielde’s tenure with Kaye’s companies, including the terms and conditions of Rosefielde’s engagement, his compensation and expenses, his title and the scope of his duties, his performance, the duration of his tenure, and the reasons for his termination.\n[ (Footnote omitted).]\nJudge Nugent found, and the record supports, that Rosefielde’s role as a lawyer proved to be the genesis of this civil dispute and the central basis for the liability asserted. From the moment Kaye and Rosefielde were introduced, the former sought and relied on the latter’s legal advice for both personal and business-related matters. A self-made man with limited formal education, Kaye relied on Rosefielde for personal tax advice and expected him to oversee his estate planning. Toward that end, Rosefielde created a number of trusts that Kaye believed were intended to shield, as much as legally possible, his personal wealth from taxation, thereby maximizing the size of his estate for the benefit of his children.\nFrom Kaye’s perspective, Judge Nugent found that the relationship between these two men evolved over time to the point that Kaye considered Rosefielde to be a “friend and confidant on whom Kaye built an absolute trust.” Kaye also arranged for Rosefielde to become a member of the board of directors of Flagship.\nAccording to Judge Nugent, in 2002, five years after the two men first met, Kaye was so impressed with Rosefielde’s business acumen that Kaye asked him to run his businesses in Atlantic City on a full-time basis. Kaye saw this as an opportunity “to phase out of the day-to-day management of his businesses, and to devote more time to his family.” Rosefielde, however, was not initially receptive to the proposal and agreed only to assist Kaye in the day-to-day management of his Atlantic City operations for a four-month period, from September 2002 to December 2002.\nJudge Nugent found that Rosefielde’s initial reluctance to accept Kaye’s job offer on a full-time basis strengthened Kaye’s resolve to convince Rosefielde to do otherwise. Thus, Kaye asked Rosefielde what it would take to convince him to work for Kaye fulltime. In the end, Kaye agreed to provide Rosefielde a consulting fee of $500,000 per year, payable to Plumrose, Rosefielde’s consulting company. Kaye also agreed to provide Rosefielde with a selection of wines and a wine storage cabinet. Finally, because Rosefielde resided in Florida, Kaye agreed to pay Rose-fielde’s commuting expenses to and from his residence in Florida and Kaye’s businesses in Atlantic City. Despite these generous benefits, Rosefielde only agreed to serve in this position for a one-year period.\nOf particular relevance and key importance to the events that ultimately lead to this extensive litigation, Judge Nugent found that Rosefielde accepted Kaye’s offer on the condition that Rose-fielde would have total authority to make all business-related decisions and operate Kaye’s entities with absolute autonomy from the board of directors. Judge Nugent found, and the record supports, that Kaye “made an unconditional pact that he would back Rosefielde,” and, “[w]ith few exceptions,” Kaye “honorfed] that unconditional pact for nearly two years.”\nJudge Nugent found, by a preponderance of the credible evidence, that Kaye hired Rosefielde to serve as COO and general counsel to both Flagship and Atlantic Palace. He also found that Rosefielde held himself out as such. Judge Nugent cited to and quoted from a press release, which announced Rosefielde’s hiring, described his legal education, professional history, and tax law expertise, and listed a number of famous clients that Rosefielde and his former law partner represented, including “Neil Sedaka, The Bee Gees, Rod Stewart, Bette Midler, and Motown Records.” The record also contains overwhelming evidence to support Judge Nugent’s finding that Flagship and Atlantic Palace’s employees considered Rosefielde to be the companies’ attorney.\nJudge Nugent found that Rosefielde was practicing law when he acquired his interests in La Sammana Management, La Sammana, and BA Management. Finding Kaye’s account of these events credible, the trial court found that Kaye originally hired Rose-fielde based on his legal knowledge, training, skill, and ability. Rosefielde used these skills throughout their association. Rose-fielde drafted, on behalf of the three companies, the agreements in which he acquired his ownership and income interests. Rosefielde also regularly drafted and edited legal documents for Kaye’s entities, such as releases, settlement agreements, and affidavits.\nRosefielde held himself out as general counsel in La Sammana’s business plan, a document he helped develop months before acquiring his interest in that company. He also used his legal training and experience in September 2004 when he formed and made himself a part owner of BA Management. Against these findings, Judge Nugent concluded that Rosefielde was practicing law throughout his tenure as COO and general counsel for Flagship and Atlantic Palace.\nJudge Nugent also rejected Rosefielde’s argument that he neither acted as Kaye’s attorney nor performed legal services for Kaye personally. Rosefielde and Kaye interacted with one another as attorney and client. Kaye relied on Rosefielde’s guidance and legal advice. Rosefielde represented Kaye in his personal, family, and business matters, and Kaye perceived and considered Rosefielde to be his attorney. Throughout their relationship, both business and personal, Rosefielde did not take any action to clarify that his role as a lawyer was limited to representing the business entities exclusively, nor Kaye individually. Indeed, a rational fact-finder could reasonably conclude that Rosefielde tacitly, if not actively, encouraged the notion that he was Kaye’s point man on all legal matters, whether business related or personal in nature.\nJudge Nugent found that Rosefielde disregarded Flagship’s bylaws as well as Atlantic Palace’s and La Sammana’s operating agreements. Rosefielde dealt directly with Kaye, circumventing Flagship’s board of directors on all major corporate decisions, including the establishment of Rosefielde’s position, title, authority, and compensation. Judge Nugent also found that Rosefielde acted as the Lattugas’ personal attorney and as the attorney for their company, JFL Ventures, when he acquired the Lattugas’ 10 percent ownership interest in La Sammana in 2004.\nWe are bound to defer to the trial court’s factual findings, as long as they are supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence. Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 65 N.J. 474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974) (citation omitted). In a case in which the trial judge also sat as the trier of facts, we are precluded from disturbing the judge’s factual findings and legal conclusions, “ ‘unless we are convinced that they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.’ ” Seidman v. Clifton Savings Bank, S.L.A., 205 N.J. 150, 169, 14 A.3d 36 (2011) (quoting Rova Farms, supra, 65 N.J. at 484, 323 A.2d 495).\nWe are also bound to defer to the trial judge’s findings that are “substantially influenced by his opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the ‘feel’ of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.” State v. Locurto, 157 N.J. 463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (quoting State v. Johnson, 42 N.J. 146, 161-62, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). However, we do not owe any deference to the legal conclusions reached by the trial court, because our review of the law is de novo. Borough of Harvey Cedars v. Karan, 214 N.J. 384, 401-02, 70 A.3d 524 (2013) (citing Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., 140 N.J. 366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).\nWe are satisfied that Judge Nugent’s extensive recitation of his factual findings with respect to Rosefielde’s role as general counsel and COO of Flagship and Atlantic Palace, as well as his role in drafting both the documents that created La Sammana Management and La Sammana’s operating agreement, are supported by the competent evidence and are consistent with our own comprehensive review of the record described in sections II, III, and IV of this opinion.\nVIII\nBREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND LEGAL MALPRACTICE\nPlaintiffs seek the equitable remedy of rescission of Rosefielde’s ownership interests in La Sammana Management, La Sammana, and BA Management, based on his role in the formation of these entities and his subsequent conduct in their operation. Plaintiffs’ theories of liability are grounded on legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.\nDefendants claim that Rosefielde did not act as an attorney when he drafted the documents that gave him an ownership interest in these entities, because he was not representing “a client” in any of these transactions. Defendants argue that the Supreme Court did not intend to apply the conflict of interest prohibitions in RPC 1.8 to lawyers who serve as a business entity’s in-house counsel. Finally, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the equitable principles of estoppel and unclean hands as well as the legal concept of waiver. Judge Nugent rejected defendants’ arguments. So do we.\nAs previously noted, the record supports Judge Nu-gent’s findings that Kaye hired and considered Rosefielde to be both his personal attorney and COO and general counsel of Flagship and Atlantic Palace. Those findings are therefore binding on this court. Rova Farms, supra, 65 N.J. at 484, 323 A.2d 495. It is immaterial that the lawyer and the client did not execute a specific retainer memorializing the attorney-client relationship. To form an attorney-client relationship, it is enough that the attorney has voluntarily agreed and acted as the client’s legal advisor, and the client equally willingly sought and was guided by the attorney’s counsel. As noted by the Court, “[Representation is inherently a consensual relationship founded upon the lawyer affirmatively accepting a professional responsibility.” In re Silverman, 113 N.J. 193, 207, 549 A.2d 1225 (1988). The acceptance of this relationship “need not necessarily be articulated, in writing or speech but may, under certain circumstances, be inferred from the conduct of the parties.” In re Palmieri, 76 N.J. 51, 58-59, 385 A.2d 856 (1978).\nDefendants nevertheless argue that Judge Nugent erred in failing to appreciate that neither Kaye, Atlantic Palace, or Flagship were parties to the formation of La Sammana Management and that Rosefielde did not represent any of the other parties that formed La Sammana Management. According to defendants, even if Rosefielde had acted as an attorney for Kaye and Flagship on May 31, 2003, RPC 1.8 does not bar Rosefielde’s interest in La Sammana Management, because he was not serving as an attorney for any of the parties involved.\nWe reject these arguments substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Nugent. The record clearly establishes that the creation of La Sammana Management did not serve Kaye’s business interests, only Rosefielde’s unwarranted financial interests. As Judge Nugent explained:\nKaye made the decision to form the company against his own judgment and against that of his Chief Financial Officer who believed that the new company would unnecessarily increase the costs of [La Sammana]. Kaye made the /decision to form the company solely because Rosefielde, his attorney in whom he had placed his complete trust, recommended it. Kaye therefore ignored his own independent judgment and kept his promise to unconditionally support Rosefielde’s decisions.\nTo the extent that Rosefielde acquired an ownership interest in [La Sammana Management], that interest was adverse to the interest of Kaye, Kaye’s children, Kaye’s trusts, and Kaye’s businesses. Rosefielde was therefore required to comply with RPC 1.8(a).\n[ (Emphasis added).]\nDefendants nevertheless argue that the requirements of RPC 1.8 are not applicable to Rosefielde’s actions in his capacity as general counsel. Defendants maintain that “the business judgment rule” is the more suitable and facially logical standard for assessing Rosefielde’s conduct as a “corporate officer.” See Seidman v. Clifton Sav. Bank, S.L.A., 205 N.J. 150, 154, 14 A.3d 36 (2011). According to defendants, the Supreme Court intended that the ethical mandates set forth in RPC 1.8(a) would apply only in the traditional attorney-client relationship.\nTo illustrate the ostensible self-evident quality of their argument, defendants suggest that the following preposterous scenario would likely ensue if the requirements of RPC 1.8(a) were to be literally applied to an attorney serving as in-house counsel. Before accepting an employment offer from a corporate client, a putative in-house counsel,\nwould have to (1) insist that he [or she] be hired through a written agreement; (2) recommend in writing that the company seek advice of independent legal counsel; and (3) have the company give “informed consent” to the hiring in a signed writing. This process would repeat every time the attorney negotiated a monetary bonus or an equity interest.\nDefendants’ “straw man” strategy is unavailing, because plaintiffs are not arguing that Rosefielde used his superior legal skills to negotiate a “sweetheart deal” for himself when he was first hired as general counsel. The record shows that, throughout his tenure as general counsel, Rosefielde concocted a series of schemes designed to enrich himself at his clients’ expense.\nAs avaricious and transparently duplicitous as Rosefielde’s conduct was in forming La Sammana Management, Judge Nugent found that his acquisition of the Lattugas’ 10 percent interest in La Sammana presented an even “[m]ore compelling” example of Rosefielde’s unethical conduct and clear violation of his ethical obligations under RPC 1.8(a).\nWhen Rosefielde acquired Lattuga’s 10% interest, [Xa SammanaJ was owned by Kaye (70%), the Bruce Kaye Dynasty Trust (10%), JFL Ventures Inc., (10%), and Dennis Richard (10%). Rosefielde was General Counsel to [La SammanaJ, Lattu-ga’s attorney, JFL Venture’s attorney and Kaye’s attorney. Rosefielde’s acquisition of the Lattuga (JLF Venture) 10% interest was fraught with conflicts. Yet, Rosefielde did not comply with RPC 1.8(a) by advising Kaye and [La SammanaJ of the desirability of seeking independent legal counsel, and by obtaining the written informed consent of Kaye and [La SammanaJ.\nIndependent of the particular facts of this case, we also discern no rational basis to exempt attorneys who have been hired by corporate clients to serve as in-house counsel from the ethical requirements of RPC 1.8. As we do in all cases that involve statutory or regulatory interpretation, we begin our analysis by trying to divine the intent of the drafter (in this case the Supreme Court) by giving the language under review its “ordinary, generally accepted meaning.” In re Plan for the Abolition of the Council on Affordable Housing, 214 N.J. 444, 467, 70 A.3d 559 (2013) (citations omitted). If the language of RPC 1.8 is clear on its face, our task is complete. DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005).\nAs an intermediate appellate court, we have no authority to substitute our judgment or views for terms of art that the Supreme Court explicitly chose to include or exclude when it drafted and approved RPC 1.8. Our Supreme Court has the plenary and exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law and the commensurate obligation to oversee the discipline of attorneys. N.J. Const. art. 6, § 2, ¶ 3; R. 1:20—1(a); R.M. v. Supreme Court of N.J., 185 N.J. 208, 213-14, 883 A.2d 369 (2005). We are not at liberty to rewrite a plainly written regulation promulgated by the Court.\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the language in RPC 1.8(a):\nA lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:\n(1) the transaction and terms in which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner that can be understood by the client;\n(2) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel of the client’s choice concerning the transaction; and\n(3) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer’s role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the transaction.\nWe find nothing in the plain language used by the Court to suggest or even imply that lawyers who are retained by corporate clients as in-house or general counsel are exempt from the proscriptions of RPC 1.8(a). Indeed, the Court has recognized the unique role of an in-house counsel and addressed the limitations and responsibilities of that office in Rule 1:27-2. Of particular relevance here, the Court emphasized: “Except as specifically limited herein, the rules, rights and privileges governing the practice of law in this State shall be applicable to a lawyer admitted under this Rule.” R. 1:27-2 (emphasis added). Nothing in the language employed by the Court exempts Rosefielde, in his capacity as in-house counsel, from the requirements of RPC 1:8(a).\nHere, Rosefielde acted in a manner that was utterly inconsistent with the ethical responsibilities applicable to attorneys in this State. Although he was not admitted to the New Jersey Bar, he had the privilege of functioning in the limited capacity of in-house counsel, as that term is defined by the Court in Rule 1:27-2(a). He also had the concomitant responsibility to adhere to the requirements and limitations of Rule 1:27-2, which includes a commitment to comply with the ethical obligations of RPC 1.8(a). Petit-Clair v. Nelson, 344 N.J.Super. 538, 542, 782 A.2d 960 (App.Div.2001).\nAs we noted in the context of professionals involved in the delivery of health care, those who “engage in a highly regulated business which directly impacts upon the safety and welfare of the public, such as the delivery of health care,” or in this case the practice of law, “are constructively on notice of the existence of legal requirements governing its practice and operations.” Open MRI of Morris & Essex, L.P. v. Frieri, 405 N.J.Super. 576, 584, 966 A.2d 48 (App.Div.2009) (quoting Material Damage Adj. Corp. v. Open MRI of Fairview, 352 N.J.Super. 216, 227, 799 A.2d 731 (Law Div.2002)). Thus, “even a good faith belief that one is performing these services in a reasonable or otherwise sound manner is not a defense.... Sound public policy can accept no lesser standard.” Ibid. (quoting Material Damage Adj. Corp., supra, 352 N.J.Super. at 227, 799 A.2d 731).\nThirty-three years ago, the Supreme Court admonished attorneys in this State that violations of RPC 1.8(a) would not be tolerated. In re Wolk, 82 N.J. 326, 335, 413 A.2d 317 (1980). In the Court’s own words: “This Court will no more tolerate the hoodwinking of helpless clients out of funds in a business venture that is essentially for the benefit of the lawyer than it will outright misappropriation of trust funds.” Ibid. (citing In re Wilson, 81 N.J. 451, 409 A.2d 1153 (1979)). The Court reiterated its commitment to deterring attorney misconduct associated with attorney-client business ventures seven years later. In re Smyzer, 108 N.J. 47, 57, 527 A.2d 857(1987).\nThe Court’s most recent comments on the subject, written by Justice Zazzali, echoed the Court’s prior warning, declaring:\nIn view of the trust placed in an attorney by his [or her] clients and the attorney’s often superior expertise in complicated financial matters, a lawyer must take every possible precaution in ensuring that his [or her] client is fully aware of the risks inherent in the proposed transaction and of the need for independent and objective advice.\n[In re Frost, 171 N.J. 308, 328, 793 A.2d 699 (2002) (alteration in original) (quoting In re Smyzer, supra, 108 N.J. at 55, 527 A.2d 857).]\nThe record before us is clear that Rosefielde did not heed these admonitions and misused and violated the trust reposed in him by plaintiffs in his capacity as their legal advisor and breached his fiduciary duty to act at all times in furtherance of their interests. Rosefielde committed these acts to enrich himself at plaintiffs’ expense.\nJudge Nugent also found that Rosefielde fraudulently acquired an ownership interest in BA Management by misrepresenting the formation document’s content and legal significance to Kaye. The record supports the facts underlying Judge Nugent’s decision. Judge Nugent accepted Kaye’s testimony on this subject as credible. Locurto, supra, 157 N.J. at 471, 724 A.2d 234. Thus, the evidence shows that Rosefielde intentionally misrepresented the BA Management agreement as a document related to a trust Kaye wanted to establish for his children. Rosefielde produced only the signature page of the document, which Kaye signed without hesitation.\nOn these facts, Judge Nugent found that Rosefielde committed common law fraud by misrepresenting the document’s content and legal significance, material facts that Rosefielde knew to be false, which Rosefielde intended Kaye to rely on and which Kaye reasonably relied on, proximately causing Kaye damages as a result. See Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, 148 N.J. 582, 610, 691 A.2d 350 (1997).\nWe therefore affirm Judge Nugent’s decision as reflected in paragraph two of his November 1, 2007 order and judgment, to rescind Rosefielde’s ownership interests granted by the La Sam-mana management agreement dated May 1, 2003, the Lattuga severance agreement dated July 11, 2004, and the BA Management agreement dated September 7, 2004. We also affirm the rescission of any income that defendants derived from these illicit transactions.\nIX\nMALPRACTICE AND THE AWARD OF COUNSEL FEES\nTo establish legal malpractice, a plaintiff must show: “(1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship creating a duty of care by the defendant attorney, (2) the breach of that duty by the defendant, and (3) proximate causation of the damages claimed by the plaintiff.” McGrogan v. Till, 167 N.J. 414, 425, 771 A.2d 1187 (2001) (citing Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, 145 N.J. 395, 416, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996)). The record here is replete with evidence supporting the first and second elements. There is no question that Rosefielde’s conduct in his dealings with plaintiffs deviated from the standards of professional competence expected of an attorney in this State. We are less sanguine, however, about Judge Nugent’s proximate cause analysis, especially as subsequently used by Judge Nugent to support the amount of counsel fees he awarded to plaintiffs.\nA negligent attorney who commits malpractice “is responsible for the reasonable legal expenses and attorney fees incurred by a former client in prosecuting the legal malpractice action.” Saffer v. Willoughby, 143 N.J. 256, 272, 670 A.2d 527 (1996). The Court extended this principle in Packard-Bamberger & Co. v. Collier, 167 N.J. 427, 442, 771 A.2d 1194 (2001), to cases involving “an intentional violation of a fiduciary duty arising as a result of the attorney-client relationship.” The defendant in Packard-Bamberger served as both corporate director and legal counsel to the corporation. 167 N.J. at 442, 771 A.2d 1194.\nSimilar to Rosefielde’s dual role as COO and general counsel, the defendant in Packard-Bamberger, Amster, had both an ethical and professional duty as a lawyer and a fiduciary duty as a corporate officer. As the Court explained:\nAmster’s duties as a director and legal counsel basically overlapped. Amster owed fiduciary duties to PB [the plaintiff] in both of his roles, and his misconduct breached his duties as a director and as an attorney. Because Amster violated the duty he owed to PB as legal counsel, the trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees was proper. In contrast, if Amster had not been counsel to PB, his fiduciary duty to PB would have arisen solely from his status as a director. He would not have rendered any legal services to the corporation and, therefore, attorneys’ fees would not have been appropriate unless authorized by contract, statute, or some other specific rule.\n[Id. at 443, 771 A.2d 1194.]\nHere, Judge Nugent concluded that Rosefielde acted as general counsel, Kaye’s personal attorney, and COO. Rosefielde committed malpractice by violating RPC 1.8(a) and by fraudulently obtaining his interest in BA Management. In Judge Nugent’s words: “RPC 1.8 exists to guard against precisely the harm occasioned by Rosefielde’s conduct and self-dealing with his clients.” Judge Nugent found plaintiffs’ legal malpractice expert’s testimony credible and persuasive on the question of whether Rosefielde committed malpractice. He concluded that Rose-fielde’s fraudulent conduct creating BA Management and obtaining an interest therein constituted malpractice per se. On these bases, Judge Nugent found that plaintiffs were entitled to compensatory damages that included counsel fees and the cost for prosecuting the malpractice action.\nDefendants argue that Judge Nugent misapplied the Court’s holding in Packard-Bamberger, because an award of attorneys’ fees is only appropriate in a case establishing intentional misconduct on the part of an attorney. Although we do not agree with defendants’ narrow construction of the Court’s holding in Pack-ardr-Bamberger, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support intentional misconduct by Rosefielde.\nAs Judge Nugent correctly found, Rosefielde’s interest in La Sammana Management was larger than Kaye had authorized and was larger than the interest of the trust that Kaye had created. However, Kaye was unaware of the extent of the combined compensation and ownership interest that Rosefielde gave himself when he drafted these documents. Furthermore, despite defendants’ assertion that Rosefielde did not engage in intentional misconduct in acquiring his interest in La Sammana because Wolfe, Valenti, and Kaye all knew and supported the idea, the evidence supports Judge Nugent’s finding that Kaye did not propose or even know of Rosefielde’s acquisition of Lattuga’s interest.\nWith respect to BA Management, defendants contend that the undisputed facts established that Kaye had complete control of that entity, that it had no assets or value, that other entities controlled by Kaye declined to enter into any agreements with it, and that the entity was dissolved shortly after Rosefielde was terminated. These facts, however, do not refute Kaye’s testimony that Rosefielde never disclosed the existence of BA Management to him and that he only found out about its existence after Rosefielde’s separation in January 2005. In our view, Rosefielde set up this entity to create the potential of future income to himself. Judge Nugent correctly held that Rosefielde breached his duty to plaintiffs when he established BA Management.\nOur concern with the trial court’s ruling stems from the amount of counsel fees awarded to plaintiffs and its relationship to actual damages proximately caused by Rosefielde’s malpractice. As actual compensatory damages, Judge Nugent found that plaintiffs were entitled to receive the $4000 incurred in connection with Rosefielde’s trip to Las Vegas. Although he also ordered the rescission of Rosefielde’s ownership interests in the three closely-held corporations, he did not articulate a reliable method for assessing the market value of these shares. Judge Nugent did not find any other actual damages resulting from Rosefielde’s actions, including the claims of attorney malpractice, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty.\nDespite this, Judge Nugent awarded plaintiffs $803,189.99 in counsel fees. He explained his reasoning in a detailed twenty-two-page memorandum. According to Judge Nugent, plaintiffs were entitled to recover 75 percent of their fees of $1,030,297.84. He found that plaintiffs successfully prosecuted the Lattuga release, the La Sammana Management agreement, and the BA Management agreement. Judge Nugent found that plaintiffs were only partially successful in prosecuting the legal malpractice and fraud in reimbursements, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and unfaithful servant. The ultimate award of $803,189.99 reflected 75 percent of costs, with a slight reduction of the fees charged by the legal malpractice expert in his analysis of plaintiffs’ claims under the “Do Not Call” law. Finally, Judge Nugent awarded defendants 10 percent of their counsel’s fees and costs based on indemnification for count four of the second amended complaint (legal malpractice involving the FTC investigation and fines), totaling $86,514.23. Thus, he awarded plaintiffs a net total of $716,675.76 for fees and costs.\nDefendants argue that Judge Nugent erred by allocating 70 percent of the fees to claims where no relief was granted and that it was unfair to award less than 20 percent for Rosefielde’s counterclaims. Defendants maintain that no more than 10 percent of the fees were related to the three rescinded transactions.\nIn all fee applications, a court must carefully and critically evaluate the lodestar, which is the fee based on “ ‘aggregate hours and specific hourly rates’ ” submitted by counsel for the prevailing party and it should not “ ‘accept passively' ” counsel’s submissions. Walker v. Giuffre, 209 N.J. 124, 131, 35 A.3d 1177 (2012) (quoting Rendine v. Pantzer, 141 N.J. 292, 335, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995)). A reasonable hourly rate is calculated “according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” Id. at 132, 35 A.3d 1177 (citations omitted); accord R.M. v. Supreme Court of N.J., 190 N.J. 1, 9-10, 918 A.2d 7 (2007). The trial court should then reduce the lodestar if the plaintiff achieved only partial success when compared with the relief sought. Packard-Bamberger, supra, 167 N.J. at 446, 771 A.2d 1194. However, the ultimate fee award need not be proportionate to the amount of damages recovered by the plaintiff. Rendine, supra, 141 N.J. at 336, 661 A.2d 1202.\nParties will be considered prevailing “ ‘if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.’ ” R.M., supra, 190 N.J. at 9-10, 918 A.2d 7 (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 50 (1983)). Further, the Court has rejected the application of “ ‘a mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon’ because ‘[s]uch a ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable fee in light of all the relevant factors.’ ” New Jerseyans for a Death Penalty Moratorium v. N.J. Dep’t of Corr., 185 N.J. 137, 154, 883 A.2d 329 (2005) (alteration in original) (quoting Silva v. Autos of Amboy, Inc., 267 N.J.Super. 546, 555-56, 632 A.2d 291 (App.Div.1993)).\nJudge Nugent correctly determined that plaintiffs prevailed in a significant number of areas. However, plaintiffs were only able to show limited damages. Although the rescission of Rosefielde’s share of three entities and the award of $4000 is not nominal, we conclude that Judge Nugent’s 75 percent analysis is not supported by the quantifiable damage award and constitutes a mistaken exercise of discretion. Although Judge Nugent correctly found that plaintiffs successfully established their breach of fiduciary claim, he did not award compensatory or disgorgement damages based on that theory of liability.\nJudge Nugent found that plaintiffs did not sustain quantifiable compensatory damages on their claims based on civil fraud and unfaithful servant. Plaintiffs’ methodology for establishing the value of Rosefielde’s share of the three entities was based on speculation as to future sales. There was no indication of their worth at the time Rosefielde parted with Kaye and left his positions as COO and general counsel. Plaintiffs did not show that they were damaged by the creation of BA Management, because it never functioned as an entity.\nWe thus remand for the trial court to recalculate the amount of counsel fees plaintiffs are entitled to receive guided by the principles outlined herein.\nX\nPUNITIVE DAMAGES\nDefendants argue that the punitive damages award was unwarranted. They assert: (1) a court of equity may not award punitive damages; (2) there is no factual support in the record for punitive damages; (3) Judge Nugent violated the Punitive Damages Act by failing to bifurcate the proceedings and by prejudging the issue; and (4) attorneys’ fees do not constitute “compensatory damages” under the Punitive Damages Act. We reject defendants’ arguments as reflected in their argument points (1), (3), and (4). As to point (2), we remand for the trial court to reconsider the issue based on our discussion and holding in Section IX concerning compensatory damages.\nA\nPUNITIVE DAMAGES IN GENERAL EQUITY\nDefendants argue that the equitable relief available in the General Equity Part cannot sustain an award of punitive damages, because it lacks the indispensable prerequisite of compensatory damages. They also argue that the only purely compensatory damages awarded by the trial court was insufficient to warrant the imposition of extraordinary punitive measures. Judge Nugent disagreed:\nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs are not entitled to punitive damages because their remedy with respect to Rosefielde’s fraudulent acquisition of his interest in BA Management was equitable, and did not constitute compensatory damages. The defendants also argue that the four thousand dollars Rosefielde fraudulently obtained as business expenses was de minimus. However, the defendants fail to consider the award of counsel fees against Rosefielde for his legal malpractice and intentional misconduct in fraudulently obtaining the interest in BA Management.\n[ (Emphasis added).]\nJudge Nugent thus did not directly address defendants’ argument because, in his view, the record supported the imposition of punitive damages using the traditional platform of compensatory damages.\nRelying on Fleischer, supra, defendants claim the Court held punitive damages may not be awarded by a court of equity. Defendants reliance on Fleischer is both misplaced and misstated. Writing for the Court, Justice Heher actually stated: “[D]amages awarded in equity are ordinarily compensatory and not punitive.” 1 N.J. at 151, 62 A.2d 383 (emphasis added).\nIn our modern practice of law, it is not uncommon for parties to seek a combination of both equitable and legal relief. As our discussion of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction in Section VI of this opinion shows, the Chancery Division has jurisdiction over legal issues to the extent that they are “incidental or essential to the determination of some equitable question.” Lyn-Anna, supra, 145 N.J. at 330, 678 A.2d 683. This case amply demonstrates the application of the exercise of this power by the Chancery Division.\nThe authority of the trial court to award punitive damages is carefully circumscribed by the Punitive Damages Act (PDA), N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.9 to -5.17. It is a long-settled maxim of statutory construction that, in drafting and adopting a law, the Legislature uses words carefully and with complete awareness of their legal import. As our colleague Judge Sabatino noted in In re State Board of Education, 422 N.J.Super. 521, 536, 29 A.3d 1079 (App.Div.2011), “[i]n construing a statute, we strive to give meaning to every provision and every word contained within that statute.” Here, in adopting the PDA, the Legislature provided as follows:\nb. In determining whether punitive damages are to be awarded, the trier of fact shall consider all relevant evidence, including but not limited to, the following:\n(1) The likelihood, at the relevant time, that serious harm would arise from the defendant’s conduct;\n(2) The defendant’s awareness of reckless disregard of the likelihood that the serious harm at issue would arise from the defendant’s conduct;\n(3) The conduct of the defendant upon learning that its initial conduct would likely cause harm; and\n(4) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by the defendant.\nc. If the trier of fact determines that punitive damages should be awarded, the trier of fact shall then determine the amount of those damages. In making that determination, the trier of fact shall consider all relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, the following:\n(1) All relevant evidence relating to the factors set forth in subsection b. of this section;\n(2) The profitability of the misconduct to the defendant;\n(3) When the misconduct was terminated; and\n(4) The financial condition of the defendant.\n[N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12 (emphasis added).]\nBy intentionally using the term “trier of fact” as opposed to “jury,” the Legislature unmistakably acknowledged the power of judges to award punitive damages when they sit as the trier of fact, as Judge Nugent did here. Indeed, the Supreme Court unequivocally recognized the Chancery Division’s authority to award punitive damages in probate matters, provided the award of punitive damages is warranted by the facts and the probate court adheres to the provisions of the PDA. In re Estate of Stockdale, 196 N.J. 275, 308, 953 A.2d 454 (2008); In re Niles, 176 N.J. 282, 300, 823 A.2d 1 (2003).\nWe turn next to defendants’ second argument point, the lack of a factual basis to impose punitive damages. Under the PDA, plaintiffs must prove, “by clear and convincing evidence,” that,\nthe harm suffered was the result of the defendant’s acts or omissions, and such acts or omissions were actuated by actual malice or accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of persons who foreseeably might be harmed by those acts or omissions. This burden of proof may not be satisfied by proof of any degree of negligence including gross negligence.\n[N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(a) (emphasis added).]\nN.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.10 defines “actual malice” as “an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an evil-minded act” and “wanton and willful disregard” as “a deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm to another and reckless indifference to the consequences of such act or omission.” N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(b)(1) requires plaintiffs to show “[t]he likelihood, at the relevant time, that serious harm would arise from the defendant’s conduct.”\nJudge Nugent concluded that Rosefielde fraudulently acquired his interest in BA Management and intended to defraud Kaye and others out of $1,000,000 over five years. He found that Rose-fielde’s actions in acquiring the interest “were actuated by actual malice and were accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of the interests of Bruce Kaye and others who would have been defrauded had Rosefielde’s misconduct not been discovered.” Giv en the trust Kaye placed in Rosefielde and the unchecked control over the entities at the time Rosefielde fraudulently acquired his interest in BA Management, Judge Nugent concluded that there was a substantial likelihood that Rosefielde’s scheme would have succeeded.\nThe record supports that Rosefielde did not disclose the existence of BA Management to Kaye and that Kaye discovered its existence only after Rosefielde had separated from his employment. However, although Rosefielde set up this entity with the potential of wrongfully diverting future income to himself, to Kaye’s clear detriment, there is no evidence that Kaye suffered actual damages. Any potential economic injury to Kaye was cured by the remedy of rescission. Rosefielde’s valuation of his potential interest in BA Management at $1,000,000 was based on speculative estimates of future income. Punitive damages for actions constituting attorney malpractice, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty require a showing that plaintiffs were actually damaged by Rosefielde’s actions. The record here does not support such a finding.\nThe $4000 award in connection with the Las Vegas trip is unquestionably a form of compensatory damages. “The goal of compensatory damages is to restore the plaintiff to the same position it was in prior to the occurrence of the wrong. This is true whether the wrong inflicted lies in contract or tort.” Material Damage Adj. Corp., supra, 352 N.J.Super. at 232, 799 A.2d 731. Furthermore, Judge Nugent found, and the record shows, that Rosefielde was well aware of the fact that his presence in Las Vegas was not business-related. He nevertheless submitted a voucher and obtained the reimbursement of his personal expenses, knowing that no one would dare to question him.\nJudge Nugent concluded that Rosefielde “engaged in that conduct with a willful and wanton disregard of his corporate fiduciary obligations and the harm, albeit relatively minor, that would occur to the corporation.” Judge Nugent also emphasized that, even after Rosefielde was confronted at trial with these proofs, he steadfastly defended his untenable position. Defendants’ argument attacking Judge Nugent’s alleged failure to bifurcate the proceedings lacks sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. R. 2:11 — 3(e)(1)(E).\nEqually meritless is defendants’ argument that counsel fees are not “compensatory damages” in a legal malpractice action. As Judge Nugent noted:\nThe Punitive Damages Act defines compensatory damages as “damages intended to make good the loss of an injured party, and no more.” N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.10. The term includes general and special damages and does not include nominal, exemplary or punitive damages. Ibid. The award of counsel fees in a legal malpractice action constitutes compensatory damages. See Saffer v. Willoughby, 143 N.J. 256, 272 [670 A.2d 527] (1996) (holding that a successful claimant in a legal malpractice action is entitled to reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees as consequential damages.); Grubbs v. Knoll, 376 N.J.Super. 420, 431 [870 A.2d 713] (App.Div.2005) (explaining that award of fees in connection with a fee application in a legal malpractice action consequential [sic] compensatory damages). Moreover, the Punitive Damages Act makes no reference to a de minimus claim. Rather, the Act requires that compensatory damages be more than nominal damages, and defines nominal damages as “damages that are not designed to compensate a plaintiff and are less than $500.” N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.10. The attorneys’ fees allocated to the plaintiffs’ claim for rescission concerning BA Management clearly exceeded $500.00.\nWe are in complete agreement with Judge Nugent on this point. Thus on remand, the trial court must reexamine whether punitive damages are warranted under the PDA, and if so, how much they should be. In performing this analysis, the court may consider an award of counsel fees based on legal malpractice as compensatory damages. N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.10 However, the court must identify with particularity the conduct that warrants punitive damages using the standard established by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(b) and (c). Thereafter, any award of punitive damages must fall within the cap established by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.14(b).\nXI\nROSEFIELDE’S CEPA CLAIMS\nOn the question of Rosefielde’s CEPA claims, relying on Feldman v. Hunterdon Radiological Associates, 187 N.J. 228, 901 A.2d 322 (2006), Judge Nugent concluded that Rosefielde did not qualify for employee status under CEPA. Defendants note that almost two weeks after Judge Nugent’s ruling, the Supreme Court decided D’Annunzio v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, 192 N.J. 110, 927 A.2d 113 (2007), and Stomel v. City of Camden, 192 N.J. 137, 927 A.2d 129 (2007), which defendants claim provide a solid factual and legal basis for Rosefielde’s CEPA claim. We disagree.\nJudge Nugent conducted a complete and thorough analysis using the Feldman standard:\nRosefielde does not meet the [Feldman ] test for an employee. Rosefielde’s work was virtually unsupervised. Although Rosefielde reported to Kaye, Rosefielde had Kaye’s unqualified support. Kaye backed Rosefielde even when he disagreed with Rosefielde’s decision, as illustrated by the creation of La Sammana Management. Rosefielde was capable of influencing virtually every aspect of the operation of Flagship, Atlantic Palace, and other related companies as well. Neither Kaye nor Rosefielde intended that Rosefielde be treated as an employee. Instead, Rose-fielde was treated as a consultant retained through Rosefielde’s Florida Corporation. Rosefielde simply does not qualify as an “employee” within the meaning of the Conscientious Employee Protection Act.\nIn D’Annunzio v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, supra, 192 N.J. at 123, 927 A.2d 113 (quoting Pukowsky v. Caruso, 312 N.J.Super. 171, 182-83, 711 A.2d 398 (App.Div.1998)), the Court held that to resolve a summary judgment motion in a CEPA case based on whether an individual qualifies as an employee, the trial court must consider the following factors:\n(1) the employer’s right to control the means and manner of the worker’s performance; (2) the kind of occupation — supervised or unsupervised; (3) skill; (4) who furnishes the equipment and workplace; (5) the length of time in which the individual has worked; (6) the method of payment; (7) the manner of termination of the work relationship; (8) whether there is annual leave; (9) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the “employer;” (10) whether the worker accrues retirement benefits; (11) whether the “employer” pays social security taxes; and (12) the intention of the parties.\nIn Stomel, supra, 192 N.J. at 154-56, 927 A.2d 129, the Court considered the same twelve factors and held that a public defender who had his own office and worked under annual contracts was nevertheless engaged to fulfill the municipality’s public defender function required by the Municipal Public Defender’s Act, N.J.S.A. 2B:24-1 to -17, and therefore could be considered an employee under CEPA.\nBoth D’Annunzio and Stomel do not alter the test set forth in Feldman. Instead, they set forth additional factors for a judge to consider. Although Judge Nugent did not specifically consider the list of twelve factors listed in these cases, we are satisfied, as a matter of law, that applying these factors would not result in an outcome different than the one articulated by Judge Nugent.\nKaye did not control the means and manner of Rosefielde’s performance. By contrast, he gave him complete control over his businesses and did not supervise him in any way. While Rose-fielde worked at Flagship and Atlantic Palace, he was not paid wages. The money was paid as a consulting fee to an entity owned and controlled by Rosefielde. As construed by the Supreme Court in both D’Annunzio and Stomel, Rosefielde is not covered by the protections afforded to employees under CEPA.\nXII\nCROSS-APPEAL\nWe affirm Judge Nugent’s rulings and judgments on the issues raised by plaintiffs in their cross-appeal, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Nugent in his memorandum of opinion dated August 10, 2007.\nXIII\nCONCLUSION\nOn defendants’ direct appeal, we affirm the final judgment of the trial court to rescind Rosefielde’s ownership interests in La Sammana, La Sammana Management and BA Management. We affirm the trial court’s judgment finding that Rosefielde committed legal malpractice and civil fraud, both in his capacity as in-house general counsel of Kaye’s business entities and in his role as Kaye’s personal attorney.\nWe vacate the trial court’s award of counsel fees to plaintiffs and remand for the trial court to reconsider and, if necessary, recalculate the amount of counsel fees, if any, that plaintiffs are entitled to receive consistent with this opinion. We also vacate the trial court’s award of punitive damages and remand for the trial court to reconsider whether an award of punitive damages is sustainable consistent with this opinion.\nOn plaintiffs’ cross-appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\nIn the interest of clarity, we will adhere to the appellations used by the second trial judge and will refer to Bruce Kaye as \"Kaye” and to Jason Kaye as \"Jason.\" No disrespect is intended or implied to either man.\nLa Sammana Management, LLC, and BA Management did not participate as individual parties at trial and were not individually represented by counsel.\nJust over a year after filing their original complaint, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint, adding a seventh count alleging breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and unfaithful servant. Six months later, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which provided additional allegations to support this count.\nJudge Perskie retired from the judiciary on February 1, 2010.\nSee Rule 1:27-2(a).\nThe record includes: sixty-five volumes of transcripts, covering approximately 7000 pages of witness testimony and arguments of counsel at various hearings; eight volumes of appellants’ appendices, consisting of 2939 documents and exhibits; and two volumes of respondents’ appendices, consisting of 383 pages of additional documents.\nAlthough the record is not clear, we presume that Gitmore was admitted to practice law at the time.\nIn a letter sent to a mortgagor indebted to Flagship Resort, Rosefielde identified himself as an attorney “retained [by Flagship] to initiate a foreclosure against\" the mortgagor. The letter, dated October 25, 2004, is on letterhead of Rosefielde’s law office in New York City. In the letter, Rosefielde offers the debtor a settlement in lieu of foreclosure that would require the debtor to submit a quit claim deed transferring title of the property to Flagship. To what extent this document is proof of Rosefielde practicing law in New Jersey is an issue to be considered by the factfinder.\nKaye testified that Lattuga paid $200,000 for his 10 percent ownership interest in La Sammana.\nThe operating agreement defined \"Gross Revenues\" as \"all Company revenues derived from the ownership and operation of the Business or otherwise, including the financing of receivables in the ordinary course of business, and exclusive of Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancing of all or any portion of the Business.”\nA quitclaim deed is a \"deed that conveys a grantor's complete interest or claim in certain real property but that neither warrants nor proffers that the title is valid.” Black’s Law Dictionary 446 (8th ed.2004).\nBusinesses that violate the do-not-call regulations are subject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per violation. See Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, 74 Fed.Reg. 857 (Jan. 9, 2009) (codified at 16 C.F.R. § 1.98(d)) (increasing the maximum civil penalty from $11,000 to $16,000 per violation, effective February 9, 2009).\nWhen asked to clarify \"expenses,” Ibone testified that only airfare, lodging at the MGM Grand, and meals were covered. Gambling and recreational activities were not included.\nThese were images of young women dressed in extremely revealing beach-ware, spanking each other on the buttocks.\nPoplar testified that the original draft agreement dated March 2003 provided for Rosefielde to be paid 5 percent of profits as compensation for serving as \"general manager.\" Poplar was unable to explain how the compensation rose to 10 percent of gross revenues. Poplar emphasized that he could find \"nothing . . in Mr. Kaye’s testimony that he had any knowledge that it went from a 5 to a 10 percent fee.\"\nIn response to a question asked by defense counsel, Faulk named the following individuals or entities he believed were involved with La Sammana Management: \"Bruce Kaye Dynasty Trust, Howard Alter, Susan Tunney, Michael Valenti, Rose Associates of Miami, which is Mr. Rosefielde, Ronnie Stransky and Kenneth Wolfe.\"\nN.J.S.A. 34:19-2(b) defines “employee\" as “any individual who performs services for and under the control and direction of an employer for wages or other remuneration.” See also D’Annunzio v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 192 N.J. 110, 120-22, 927 A.2d 113 (2007).\nThe first three counts of plaintiffs’ second amended complaint alleged identical theories of liability: \"Breach of Fiduciary Responsibility, Fraud, and Legal Malpractice.\"\nCount four alleged legal malpractice, count five alleged \"Legal Malpractice and Theft,\" and count seven alleged \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud, and Unfaithful Servant.\"\nCount Six alleged \"Unlicensed Practice of Law\" in violation of RPC 5.5 and N.J.S.A. 2C:21-22, which renders the knowing unauthorized practice a criminal offense potentially punishable by term of imprisonment of between three to five years. Although the Criminal Code does not provide for a private cause of action, we presume plaintiffs included this statutory reference to support their claim of civil theft.\nDefendants filed a third-party complaint on August 23, 2006, against a number of Kaye-affiliated entities and attorneys who may have been retained or used by Kaye as outside counsel. Defendants primarily sought contribution and compensatory damages from these third-party defendants. The outcome of this cause of action is not germane to the issues before us.\nIn our view, it is important to emphasize that, as noted by Justice O’Hern in Lyn-Anna, these cases were decided by individuals who had \"closely observed the development of the Constitution of 1947.’’ Lyn-Anna, supra, 145 N.J. at 323, 678 A.2d 683. Indeed, Chief Justice Vanderbilt \"contributed to the Judicial Article of the new Constitution.” Ibid. The contemporaneous nature of these decisions, as related to the adoption of our 1947 Constitution, strengthens the proposition that the proponents and ultimate framers of the right to a jury trial expressed in Article I, Paragraph 9 were aware of the prevailing views of the scope and applicability of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.\nIn Steiner, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, his former attorney, refused to release to the plaintiff his legal file, as a means by the defendant of obtaining payment for services rendered. 2 N.J. at 369, 66 A.2d 719. The defendant did not dispute he asserted an attorney’s lien on the file. Ibid. The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Chancery Division, seeking an injunction directing the defendant to release his files. Id. at 370, 66 A.2d 719. The defendant counterclaimed for his legal fees and demanded a jury trial. The Court denied the attorney a right to trial by jury on the counterclaim.\nBy amendment, effective December 4, 1973, the following language was omitted: \"when the matter in dispute does not exceed fifty dollars.”\n\"The New Jersey Constitution is the supreme law of this State.\" Abbott v. Burke, 206 N.J. 332, 480, 20 A.3d 1018 (2011) (Albin, J., concurring); see also Davenport v. Apportionment Comm'n, 65 N.J. 125, 138, 319 A.2d 718 (1974) (\"It goes without question that the New Jersey Constitution is the supreme law of this State, representing the fundamental will of the people, upon which all other laws of this State repose.\") (Pashman, J., dissenting).\nThe only material difference between Judge Nugent's oral opinion and his subsequent memorandum concerns the award of punitive damages. In his oral opinion. Judge Nugent announced that the way in which Rosefielde acquired his ownership interest in BA Management constituted civil fraud and warranted an award of punitive damages. Because the record at the time did not contain any information concerning Rosefielde's financial condition, Judge Nugent permitted the parties to submit supplemental evidence for the purpose of determining the ultimate amount of punitive damages to award, including the evidential materials outlined in N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(c). In his August 10, 2007 memorandum of opinion, Judge Nugent described the role this supplemental evidence played in his ultimate determination.\nJudge Nugent found that, by labeling his salary a consulting fee, Rosefielde received a tax benefit that was not available to any other employees of Flagship. Plumrose collected the $500,000 annual fee by submitting bi-weekly invoices.\nRosefielde told Kaye that, as a wine connoisseur, he was concerned that, by accepting the position, he would not have access to the wine collection he kept in his Florida home.\nJudge Nugent also found that Kaye made this Faustian bargain knowing that, by giving Rosefielde complete authority to operate Flagship, independent of and not subject to the oversight of its board of directors, Kaye contravened Flagship’s bylaws. The parties presented no evidence regarding whether Flagship's board of directors ever considered or approved Rosefielde’s hiring.\nJustice O'Hern succinctly described the \"straw man” fallacy in his concurring opinion in Canesi v. Wilson, 158 N.J. 490, 730 A.2d 805 (1999):\nIn formal logic, the technique of setting up an argument that does not exist and then refuting that misrepresented argument is called the \"straw man” fallacy. See Douglas Walton, A Pragmatic Theory of Fallacy 57 (1995). The straw man technique is fallacious because it leads to irrelevancies and because it precludes the development and resolution of the true issues of contention. See Madsen Pirie, The Book of the Fallacy 160 (1985).\n[158 N.J. at 518, 730 A.2d 805 (quoting Philip M. Nichols, Realism, Liberalism, Values, and the World Trade Organization, 17 U. Pa. J. Int'l Econ. L. 851, 882 n. 20 (Fall 1996)).]\nPlaintiffs withdrew their unauthorized practice of law claim.\nAlthough disgorgement of Rosefielde's substantial $500,000 annual salary or \"consulting fee” may have formed the basis for punitive damages, Judge Nugent, in our view, correctly denied this form of relief to plaintiffs.",
