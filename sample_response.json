                            "text": "JUSTICE BIRKETT delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 In the course of this dissolution proceeding, petitioner, Anthony D. Peradotti, brought a petition to substitute the Honorable Joseph V. Salvi out of the case for cause. The Honorable Diane E. Winter heard and denied the petition. Judge Salvi proceeded to adjudicate the action and issue a dissolution judgment. We agree with petitioner that Judge Winter erred in denying the petition for substitution. Consequently, we reverse the denial of the petition, vacate the dissolution judgment, and remand for the assignment of the case to a different judge.\n¶ 2 I. BACKGROUND\n¶ 3 Under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 311(a)(5) (eff. July 1, 2018), the appellate court must, unless good cause is shown, issue its decision in a subject accelerated appeal within 150 days from the filing of the notice of appeal. Under that timetable, our decision was due August 30, 2018, but good cause exists for not meeting the deadline, due to the extensions of time we granted the parties to file their briefs. The extensions totaled 60 days.\n¶ 4 Petitioner filed his dissolution petition in November 2015. That same month, an appearance was entered for respondent, Michele Peradotti, by the law firm of Beermann Pritikin Mirabelli Swerdlove LLP (the Beermann firm). The case was originally assigned to the Honorable Christopher B. Morozin and later reassigned to Judge Salvi.\n¶ 5 On March 3, 2017, petitioner filed, pursuant to section 2-1001(a)(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/2-1001(a)(3) (West 2016) ), a petition to substitute Judge Salvi out of the case for cause. Petitioner supported the petition with the affidavit of attorney Jeffrey S. Braiman. In his allegations, petitioner recounted how Judge Salvi had recused himself from the case based on his nephew's employment as an associate with the Beermann firm, and how Judge Salvi later rescinded the recusal and placed himself back on the case. Specifically, petitioner alleged:\n\"7. The Honorable Joseph Salvi, an experienced trial judge, known and respected for his integrity, legal knowledge, honesty and dedication to the law, having previously been in a private practice for many years in addition to his approximately five years on the bench as an Associate Judge for the County of Lake[,] is assigned to the dissolution proceeding.\n8. The Salvi family is well known throughout the County of Lake and the State of Illinois and most likely nationally for their dedication of the law. Multiple family members are lawyers.\n9. Judge Salvi's wife is a practicing attorney in Lake County specializing in various areas of law one of which [is] matrimonial law, specifically representation of clients in divorce and representing children as a guardian ad litem and child representative.\n10. Judge Salvi has a sister who is a practicing attorney in Lake County. She is married to a practicing attorney in the County of Lake. This specific brother in law is the former law partner of Judge Salvi for many years, having a successful law practice located in Lake Zurich, Illinois prior to being appointed as an associate judge in Lake County.\n11. Her husband, Judge Salvi's brother-in-law and former law partner also specializes [in] family law and practices in the family law courts in Lake County.\n12. Judge Salvi's sister specializes in a few different areas of the law, one of which is matrimonial law, specifically representation of clients in divorce and representing children as a guardian ad litem and child representative.\n13. It is well known in the County of Lake that these family members do not practice in front of Judge Salvi as Judge Salvi has recused himself from cases involving his family members.\n14. This particular sister and brother-in-law of Judge Salvi, have a son who is also a practicing lawyer in Lake County, specifically practicing in the field of matrimonial law.\n15. Judge Salvi's nephew is within the third degree of relationships as contemplated in [Illinois]Supreme Court Rule 63(C)(1)(e) [ (eff. Feb. 2, 2017) ]. He is a second degree relative.\n16. Their son, Judge Salvi's nephew, began his legal career at a firm called Ventrelli/Simon from approximately 2015 to approximately January of 2017. Ventrelli/Simon is a matrimonial law firm that practices in Lake County. During the time that he practiced family law with Ventrelli/Simon, it was well known to the legal community that Judge Salvi generally did not allow his nephew or his nephew's firm to appear in front of him during the years of 2015, 2016 and the beginning of 2017.\n17. On or about January of 2017, Judge Salvi's nephew left the firm of Ventrelli/Simon and advanced his career as an associate with [the Beermann firm].\n18. This firm represents [respondent]. They also represent [respondent] in post-decree litigation in Cook County from a previous divorce and at the Appellate level in the 1st District Appellate Court of Illinois.\n19. On February 10, 2017, in open court, Judge Salvi disclosed to all parties that his nephew was now working at [the Beermann firm] and he recused himself; entering an order assigning the case to the Honorable Elizabeth Rochford.\n20. Thereafter, counsel for [respondent] objected and asked Judge Salvi orally to review the law and reconsider recusing himself in this case (there is no legal basis for an attorney's objection to a Judge's discretionary decision of recusal). [Petitioner's] former attorney objected to the 'objection'. See affidavit from Attorney Jeffrey S. Braiman attached and incorporated by reference into this petition as Exhibit A.\n21. Twelve (12) days later, on February 22, 2017, the matter came before the court for pretrial. New counsel for [petitioner], David R. Del Re, brought up the issue of the conflict and recusal and at that point, Judge Salvi said (not verbatim), I have researched the law, I have spoken with our Chief Judge and I am not obligated to recuse myself and I am not recusing myself.\"\nIn his affidavit, Braiman averred that (1) he was petitioner's former counsel; (2) he \"was present in court in February 10, 2017 wherein Judge Salvi disclosed to all parties the nature of the conflict and recused himself and entered an order assigning the case to the Honorable Elizabeth Rochford\"; and (3) \"[t]hereafter, counsel for [respondent] asked Judge Salvi orally to review the law and reconsider,\" to which Braiman objected.\n¶ 6 Petitioner argued that Judge Salvi's impartiality in the case was questionable due to his departure from his \"long-standing history of * * * recusing himself when cases involving his nephew's firm appear before his bench.\" Also, by rescinding his recusal, Judge Salvi raised \"serious, legitimate, objective and reasonable concerns that in the twelve days between February 10, 2017 and February 22, 2017, somehow, someway, some outside influence changed the inherent, innate, intimate and independent recusal made by Judge Salvi.\"\n¶ 7 The record contains no report of proceedings of any hearing on February 10 or 22, 2017, or any order of recusal or reinstatement by Judge Salvi. However, respondent, in her written response to the petition, and at the hearing on the petition, agreed to the essential facts alleged by petitioner, as we elaborate below. Infra ¶ 18.\n¶ 8 Respondent attached to her response documents from the Beermann firm purporting to show that Judge Salvi's nephew-identified for the first time in the case as Charles Wifler-was screened from involvement in the parties' dissolution action.\n¶ 9 The petition was assigned to Judge Winter for decision. At the hearing, the parties disagreed over whether Judge Salvi actually entered an order of recusal on February 10, 2017, but they agreed that Judge Salvi did indeed transfer the case to Judge Rochford on February 10. According to respondent, no order of recusal was entered or even drafted, but according to petitioner, a recusal order was entered and later removed from the court file. We note that the circuit court electronic docket entry for February 10 reflects that no order was entered on that date.\n¶ 10 At the hearing, petitioner reiterated the arguments in his petition and also presented two new arguments. First, petitioner claimed that it was improper for respondent's counsel to ask Judge Salvi to reconsider his decision to recuse, as counsel challenged \"Judge Salvi's inherent right to use his discretion and recuse himself.\" Second, petitioner claimed that Judge Salvi, once recused, had no authority to continue in the case, even to reconsider the recusal:\n\"Once that order is entered, which it was signed, how does Judge Salvi have the ability to then vitiate that order? How does he now, when he has recused himself and it is assigned to a new judge, have the jurisdiction to say, okay, on your oral motion, counsel, I am going to rip up that order because that's what happened?\"\n¶ 11 Judge Winter found \"problematic\" the absence of a recusal order in the court file:\n\"[Y]ou can't take back something that has already been done. Everything needs to be in the record. * * * [T]he order, if it was, in fact, entered, should be in the file even if it is vacated later so there is a good record of what has happened in a case.\"\n¶ 12 Judge Winter proceeded to deny the petition for substitution. She found that petitioner failed to meet the \"actual prejudice\" standard of In re Marriage of O'Brien , 2011 IL 109039, ¶ 31, 354 Ill.Dec. 715, 958 N.E.2d 647.\n¶ 13 Judge Salvi presided over the case through trial. In December 2017, he issued a judgment dissolving the parties' marriage and addressing such matters as parenting time and property distribution. Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied. Petitioner then filed this timely appeal.\n¶ 14 II. ANALYSIS\n¶ 15 On appeal, petitioner challenges (1) Judge Winter's denial of petitioner's petition for substitution of Judge Salvi for cause; and (2) the substance of the dissolution judgment later entered by Judge Salvi. For the following reasons, we agree that the denial of the petition was erroneous.\n¶ 16 The trial court's decision on a petition for substitution for cause will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Levaccare v. Levaccare , 376 Ill. App. 3d 503, 509, 315 Ill.Dec. 280, 876 N.E.2d 280 (2007). Petitioner presents two main reasons why the denial of his substitution petition was erroneous. First, he claims that Judge Winter, in deciding the petition, misapplied O'Brien by determining whether Judge Salvi was actually prejudiced against him rather than merely potentially prejudiced. Second, petitioner argues that, once Judge Salvi recused himself, he lost authority over the case and could be reinstated only through a remittal from the parties pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 63(D) (eff. Feb. 2, 2017), which Judge Salvi never obtained. We agree with the second point and therefore need not address the first one.\n¶ 17 Before proceeding with our analysis, we recognize that the record contains no report of proceedings, or orders, in which Judge Salvi recused or reinstated himself. Based on this omission, respondent claims that the record is inadequate to support petitioner's contentions. Regarding Braiman's affidavit describing what occurred on February 10, 2017, respondent cites authority stating that \"[a]n attorney's affidavit cannot be used to supplement the record in lieu of a transcript or a bystander's report\" ( Landau & Associates, P.C. v. Kennedy , 262 Ill. App. 3d 89, 91, 199 Ill.Dec. 534, 634 N.E.2d 373 (1994) ). Respondent also denies that she admitted the facts alleged in the petition for substitution. According to respondent, she attacked the sufficiency of petitioner's allegations without admitting them. This is not quite true. For instance, if respondent was taking no position on whether or why Judge Salvi recused himself, why would she produce documentation from the Beermann firm trying to establish that Wifler had no involvement in the case?\n¶ 18 Regardless of whether respondent made factual concessions in her written response, her counsel agreed at the hearing to the essential allegations of the substitution petition. We note particularly these comments by respondent's counsel:\n\"[I]t is not relevant what was in Judge Salvi's mind when he concluded I am not recusing myself. This is not something I feel I have to do. He made that decision.\n* * * [T]his was a matter of weeks after [Wifler] joined the firm and he says I have to recuse myself because I have always done that. First of all, that is not any kind of precedential standard. Maybe why he did that and, again, we are all sitting here speculating as to what is in Judge Salvi's mind, which I don't think is appropriate under the law, but the fact of the matter is [petitioner's counsel] says what's the difference between [the Beermann firm] and Simon and Ventrelli [ (Wifler's former firm) ]. There is a big difference.\n* * *\nNo order was entered. The docket says that. Judge Salvi came back. And when we re-approached, he had gone through an analysis. He articulated, and I agree with [petitioner's counsel's] assessment of that, and we are paraphrasing. Essentially he said I talked to Judge Ortiz. I looked at this. I researched it. He probably looked at Rule 63 and said do I really have to do this[?]\n* * * Once he comes out and says I have done that, I have done my Rule 63 analysis, I do not believe there is a conflict, I am not recusing myself, [petitioner] has the right to come in and ask your Honor to still disqualify Judge Salvi for cause. * * *\"\nLater, counsel argued:\n\"[I]n that moment, without really walking himself through this [Judge Salvi] said, well, I have always done this with Simon and Ventrelli, it is a different circumstance. Let me talk to Judge Ortiz. Let me actually look at Rule 63. Let me do that analysis. Let me, in effect, go through and walk through all of the facts and circumstances of these issues.\nHe has done that. He has done that. He has the right to do that. Whether or not there was an order, the record reflects there wasn't. If his knee jerk response was, you know, I have to recuse myself because I always did it when [Wifler] was with Simon and Ventrelli, but wait a minute, [respondent's counsel] steps up and says, Judge, as a matter of law, we don't think you have to do that. He says, well, let me take it under advisement. He goes back. And like [petitioner's counsel] said, 10 days later, 12 days later, whatever, we come back. He has done his analysis.\"\nIn the foregoing argument, respondent's counsel agreed that (1) Judge Salvi announced in court that he was recusing himself because Wifler was employed with the Beermann firm; (2) when Judge Salvi announced his recusal, respondent's counsel asked him to reconsider; and (3) several days later, Judge Salvi announced in court that he had consulted with Judge Ortiz, the chief judge, and decided to rescind the recusal.\n¶ 19 Having determined the agreed facts, we proceed to state the applicable law. Subsection (C)(1) of Rule 63 states that \"[a] judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to\" the situations specified in the subsection. Ill. S. Ct. R. 63(c)(1) (eff. Feb. 2, 2017). Subsection (C)(1)(e)(ii) of Rule 63 describes a situation corresponding to the facts here, namely where \"the judge * * *, or a person within the third degree of relationship to [him] * * * is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding.\" Ill. S. Ct. R. 63(C)(1)(e)(ii) (eff. Feb. 2, 2017). A niece or nephew of a judge is a person within the \"third degree of relationship.\" Ill. S. Ct. Code of Judicial Conduct, terminology. Subsection (D) of Rule 63 specifies a remittal process by which the parties may waive disqualification:\n\"D. Remittal of Disqualification\nA judge disqualified by the terms of Section 3C may disclose on the record the basis of the judge's disqualification and may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, out of the presence of the judge, whether to waive disqualification. If following disclosure of any basis for disqualification other than personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, the parties and lawyers, without participation by the judge, all agree that the judge should not be disqualified, and the judge is then willing to participate, the judge may participate in the proceeding. This agreement shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding.\" Ill. S. Ct. R. 63(D) (eff. Feb. 2, 2017).\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that the parties waived disqualification with respect to Wifler's employment with the Beermann firm.\n¶ 20 The issue at hand is whether Illinois law permits a recused judge to reinstate himself to a case absent a Rule 63(D) remittal. Respondent claims that People v. Kirkpatrick , 240 Ill. App. 3d 401, 181 Ill.Dec. 183, 608 N.E.2d 256 (1992), \"squarely addressed\" this issue. We read that case differently. The trial judge in Kirkpatrick did rescind his recusal, and the defendant did claim on appeal that the judge lacked the authority to reinstate himself regardless of whether the recusal was warranted, but the appellate court summarily rejected that claim because the defendant cited no authority for it. Id. at 406, 181 Ill.Dec. 183, 608 N.E.2d 256. Kirkpatrick provides no guidance here.\n¶ 21 More helpful is Brzowski v. Brzowski , 2014 IL App (3d) 130404, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20, cited by petitioner. Brzowski was a marriage-dissolution proceeding in which Judge Kennison issued an order of protection against the respondent. The respondent filed a motion to dismiss the entire proceeding, but before the motion was heard, Judge Kennison recused herself. The record did not indicate the basis for the recusal. Judge Baron reassigned the case to Judge Anderson, who struck the respondent's motion to dismiss. The respondent subsequently filed a petition for substitution, alleging that Judge Anderson was biased against him. Judge Baron ultimately assigned the case back to Judge Kennison, who granted the petitioner's motion to extend the order of protection. Judge Kennison did not obtain a Rule 63(D) remittal from the parties before she was reinstated to the case. Id. ¶¶ 8-12, 20, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20.\n¶ 22 On appeal, the respondent argued that the order extending the order of protection was invalid because Judge Kennison had, by recusing herself, relinquished authority over the case in the absence of a Rule 63(D) remittal. The appellate court considered the issue \"novel\" because it found no \"reported Illinois case specifically addressing the validity of an order entered by a judge who had previously recused herself.\" Id. ¶¶ 17, 19, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20. The court found guidance in cases addressing what power remains with a judge once he is substituted out of a case for cause under section 2-1001(a)(3) of the Code. Id. ¶ 19, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20. The court specifically mentioned In re Estate of Wilson , 238 Ill. 2d 519, 345 Ill.Dec. 583, 939 N.E.2d 426 (2010), and In re Petition of C.M.A. , 306 Ill. App. 3d 1061, 239 Ill.Dec. 920, 715 N.E.2d 674 (1999).\n¶ 23 C.M.A. was an adoption proceeding in which the petitioners brought a petition under section 1001(a)(3) of the Code to substitute Judge McDunn out of the case for cause. Judge Barth heard the petition, granted it, and reassigned the matter to himself. Later, Judge McDunn entered orders sua sponte declaring that Judge Barth lacked jurisdiction to decide the petition and that his orders in the case were void. Judge McDunn also made a substantive finding about the sufficiency of the evidence on the underlying issues in the case. C.M.A. , 306 Ill. App. 3d at 1065-66, 239 Ill.Dec. 920, 715 N.E.2d 674. On appeal, the petitioners argued that Judge McDunn had no authority to enter orders after she was removed from the case. In beginning its analysis, the appellate court stated the following principles:\n\"Illinois law firmly establishes that once a motion for substitution of judge for cause is brought, that judge loses all power and authority over the case, and any orders entered after a judge's removal or after an improper denial of such motion are of no force or effect. [Citations.] Thus, a judge who had been removed from a case for cause has no jurisdiction to enter enforceable orders in that case. Any attempt by the removed judge to rule in such a matter is futile, rendering void all orders entered by that judge after substitution for cause.\" Id. at 1067, 239 Ill.Dec. 920, 715 N.E.2d 674.\nThe court agreed with the petitioners that Judge McDunn was properly removed for cause and that, therefore, her subsequent orders in the case were invalid. Id. at 1069, 239 Ill.Dec. 920, 715 N.E.2d 674.\n¶ 24 The issue in Wilson was whether a judge who is the subject of a petition for substitution for cause can determine whether the petition meets certain threshold procedural and substantive requirements before passing it to another judge for a determination on the merits. Wilson , 238 Ill. 2d at 522, 345 Ill.Dec. 583, 939 N.E.2d 426. In holding that the challenged judge can make that threshold determination, the court commented that any judge assessing a for-cause substitution petition will have a \"powerful incentive to err on the side of caution\" because, if a judge \"den[ies] a petition for substitution under circumstances where the appellate court subsequently determines that the [request] should have been allowed, all of [the challenged judge's] subsequent rulings in the case will be invalidated.\" Id. at 568, 345 Ill.Dec. 583, 939 N.E.2d 426. For this proposition, the court cited Curtis v. Lofy , 394 Ill. App. 3d 170, 333 Ill.Dec. 41, 914 N.E.2d 248 (2009), which held (like C.M.A. ) that \" '[o]rders entered after a motion for substitution of judge has been improperly denied are void.' \" ( id. at 176, 333 Ill.Dec. 41, 914 N.E.2d 248 (quoting Illinois Licensed Beverage Ass'n v. Advanta Leasing Services , 333 Ill. App. 3d 927, 932, 267 Ill.Dec. 118, 776 N.E.2d 255 (2002) ) ).\n¶ 25 The Brzowski court interpreted Wilson and C.M.A. as holding \"that when a judge has been substituted for cause, the disqualified judge cannot enter any further orders in the case.\" Brzowski , 2014 IL App (3d) 130404, ¶ 19, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20. The court recognized that, per O'Brien , \"recusal and substitution for cause are not the same thing\" ( O'Brien , 2011 IL 109039, ¶ 45, 354 Ill.Dec. 715, 958 N.E.2d 647 ), but it maintained that, for purposes of its analysis, \"the power of a judge who has been substituted for cause is similar to the power of a judge who has voluntarily recused herself\" ( Brzowski , 2014 IL App (3d) 130404, ¶ 19 n.1, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20 ).\n¶ 26 The court also found support in foreign authority, noting that \"it is a generally accepted rule in both state and federal courts that once a judge recuses, that judge should have no further involvement in the case outside of certain ministerial acts.\" Id. ¶ 19, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20. The court cited a federal case, Moody v. Simmons , 858 F.2d 137 (3d Cir. 1988), and a law review note collecting cases on the issue (S. Matthew Cook, Note, Extending the Due Process Clause to Prevent a Previously Recused Judge from Later Attempting to Affect the Case from Which He Was Recused , 1997 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 423 (1997) ).\n¶ 27 Based on these authorities, the Brzowski court concluded that, \"when a judge is disqualified in a case, either by recusal or through a petition for substitution, that judge cannot enter any further orders in the matter.\" Brzowski , 2014 IL App (3d) 130404, ¶ 19, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20. Specifically, the disqualified judge has no power to enter \"substantive orders\" in the case but may take only \"ministerial action.\" Id. ¶ 20, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20. As there was no Rule 63(D) remittal in the record, the court vacated Judge Kennison's order extending the order of protection. Id.\n¶ 28 Like the Brzowski court, we see no difference between the effects of a disqualification for cause under section 2-1001(a)(3) of the Code and the effects of a Rule 63 recusal. There is, in turn, no ground for distinguishing between the effects of a disqualification for cause and the effects of other types of disqualification for which section 2-1001 provides, namely disqualification because of the judge's involvement in the case ( 735 ILCS 5/2-1001(a)(1) (West 2016) ) and disqualification as of right (id. § 2-1001(a)(2) ). As to what powers, if any, are retained by a judge who is disqualified under section 2-1001 or recused under Rule 63, cases like Wilson , C.M.A. , and Cofy seem to imply that a judge who was (or should have been) disqualified for cause may make no further orders at all. However, other cases on statutory judicial substitution, civil or criminal (see 725 ILCS 5/114-5(a) (West 2016) ), hold that a disqualified judge retains the power to perform ministerial functions (see People ex rel. Walker v. Pate , 53 Ill. 2d 485, 505, 292 N.E.2d 387 (1973) ), such as entering orders necessary to transfer the matter to another judge (see Hoffmann v. Hoffmann , 40 Ill. 2d 344, 347-48, 239 N.E.2d 792 (1968) ; People v. Bell , 276 Ill. App. 3d 939, 946-47, 213 Ill.Dec. 351, 658 N.E.2d 1372 (1995) ). While Brzowski could have cited these decisions, it cited only a federal decision, Moody , in holding that a disqualified judge loses the power to enter \"substantive orders\" in the case. Brzowski , 2014 IL App (3d) 130404, ¶¶ 19-20, 387 Ill.Dec. 138, 22 N.E.3d 20.\n¶ 29 From the foregoing authorities we derive the rule that a recused or otherwise disqualified judge has no power to enter further substantive orders in the case, absent-where applicable-a Rule 63(D) remittal.\n¶ 30 Whether a disqualification is subject to reconsideration depends on the source of the disqualification. A recused judge cannot reconsider his recusal, for that would itself be a substantive decision in excess of the residual powers of a recused judge. As the Brzowski court noted, both federal and state courts are divided on whether a recused judge may rescind his recusal. Compare Doddy v. Oxy USA, Inc. , 101 F.3d 448, 457-58 (5th Cir. 1996) (rule that \"judges can do nothing after recusal other than transfer their case to another judge\" precludes a recused judge from vacating his recusal), and El Fenix de Puerto Rico v. M/Y JOHANNY , 36 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 1994) (a judge's vacatur of his recusal \"runs afoul of the general rule that the recused judge should take no further action except to enable administrative reassignment of the case\"), with United States v. Lauersen , 348 F.3d 329, 338 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"There is no reason to prohibit a judge from reconsidering a recusal decision, at least in the absence of transfer of the case to another judge.\"); compare Luce v. Cushing , 2004 VT 117, ¶ 16, 177 Vt. 600, 868 A.2d 672 (collecting cases and siding with those holding that \"a judge may rescind a recusal where valid grounds appear on the record\"), with Kells v. Davidson , 102 Fla. 684, 136 So. 450, 451 (1931) (\"It would be an unwise provision of law which would contemplate that, when a judge is once disqualified [ (by recusal) ] in a cause, the reason for his disqualification could be removed from the record, and thereupon such judge would become qualified to proceed with the disposition of the cause and act as though he had never been disqualified.\"); see W.W. Allen, Annotation, Disqualification of Judge in Pending Case as Subject to Revocation or Removal , 162 A.L.R. 641 (1946). In Illinois, the issue appears settled by the rule in Wilson and C.M.A. , as extended to recusals.\n¶ 31 In contrast to a recusal, a for-cause disqualification is indeed subject to reconsideration. The difference is that a petition seeking a for-cause disqualification is decided by a different judge from the one named in the petition. See 735 ILCS 5/2-1001(a)(3)(iii) (West 2016). \"The fact that a second judge will examine the for-cause allegations allows for an independent, neutral assessment of the allegations against the challenged judge * * *.\" O'Brien , 2011 IL 109039, ¶ 46, 354 Ill.Dec. 715, 958 N.E.2d 647. Reconsideration of a for-cause disqualification is not a substantive decision by the disqualified judge himself, though it could lead to reinstatement of that judge's authority to enter substantive decisions in the case.\n¶ 32 While the well-established rule of Wilson and C.M.A. hardly needs justification at this point, we note that sound policy exists for barring a judge from reconsidering his recusal. First, we note the extent to which a decision on recusal is insulated from independent review. \"Whether a judge should recuse himself is a decision in Illinois that rests exclusively within the determination of the individual judge , pursuant to the canons of judicial ethics found in the Judicial Code.\" (Emphasis in original.) Id. ¶ 45, 354 Ill.Dec. 715, 958 N.E.2d 647. \"The Judicial Code, which is a part of our rules, says nothing that would give the impression that its provisions could be used by a party or his lawyer as a means to force a judge to recuse himself, once the judge does not do so on his own.\" Id. Rather, a party who wishes to compel a judge's removal from a civil case must use section 2-1001 of the Code. Id. ¶ 46, 354 Ill.Dec. 715, 958 N.E.2d 647 ; see also In re S.D. , 2011 IL App (3d) 110184, ¶¶ 25-26, 352 Ill.Dec. 784, 954 N.E.2d 867 (\"Although attorneys may make the court aware of certain factors that could potentially require the trial judge to contemplate recusal, a party cannot compel a judge to step aside by 'moving' for recusal. If the parties are not satisfied with the court's ruling on an informal request for recusal, the parties may then file a motion for substitution under section 2-1001(a)(3) of [the Code] with the required affidavits in order to compel substitution in certain situations.\"). Thus, there is no independent review of a judge's refusal to recuse himself under Rule 63.\n¶ 33 Moreover, if the personal nature of a recusal decision precludes independent review of a refusal to recuse, then it would seem also to bar review of a recusal itself. In fact, Rule 63 does not even require a judge to disclose the basis for his recusal, unless he chooses to offer the parties the option of a remittal. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 63(D) (eff. Feb. 2, 2017) (\"A judge disqualified by the terms of Section 3C may disclose on the record the basis of the judge's disqualification and may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, out of the presence of the judge, whether to waive disqualification.\" (Emphases added.) ); Hassebrock v. Deep Rock Energy Corp. , 2015 IL App (5th) 140105, ¶ 51, 390 Ill.Dec. 784, 29 N.E.3d 1054 (\"Rule 63 does not mandate that a trial court state its reason for recusal on the record or in its recusal order, unless the court seeks a waiver of its disqualification.\").\n¶ 34 The personal nature of a recusal militates not only against independent review but also, perhaps ironically, against reconsideration by the judge himself. The criterion for recusal under Rule 63(C)(1) is whether the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This includes, but is not limited to, situations involving the appearance of impropriety. O'Brien , 2011 IL 109039, ¶ 43, 354 Ill.Dec. 715, 958 N.E.2d 647. Factoring into the recusal decision of a conscientious judge (which all are presumed to be) is not only the judge's concern for appearances but also his subjective assessment of his attitudes and whether they will allow impartiality in that case. Appearances can be assessed by others; the subjective component cannot. When a judge recuses himself but then changes his mind, he might leave himself open to the charge that he is, at best, uncertain, or, at worst, dishonest, about his ability to remain impartial. While some recusals might be based on sheer mistakes of fact, a bright-line rule is the best policy, and indeed the rule in Wilson and C.M.A. does not permit exceptions for disqualified judges to make substantive rulings.\n¶ 35 In the present case, once Judge Salvi recused himself, he lost all authority to decide substantive matters, including-most notably-whether he should have recused himself after all. There being no Rule 63(D) remittal in the record, Judge Salvi was without authority to reinstate himself to the case. Judge Winter, therefore, erred in denying the petition for substitution of Judge Salvi.\n¶ 36 III. CONCLUSION\n¶ 37 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the denial of petitioner's petition for substitution of Judge Salvi. We also vacate all substantive rulings following Judge Salvi's recusal, including the dissolution judgment, and remand this case for reassignment to another trial judge for disposition.\n¶ 38 Vacated and reversed.\n¶ 39 Cause remanded with directions.\nJustices McLaren and Spence concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nJudge Winter did not apply Rule 63 in determining whether Judge Salvi should remain on the case-nor, as our analysis demonstrates, did she have the authority to apply it.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE CUNNINGHAM delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 Isobel A. Hebert (executor), as executor of the estate of P. Kevin Cunningham (the decedent), filed a complaint in the circuit court of Cook County against defendant-appellant Betty Cunningham (Betty), seeking a declaratory judgment regarding funds from the decedent's 401(k) retirement account. Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the executor and against Betty. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County.\n¶ 2 BACKGROUND\n¶ 3 The decedent and Betty were married in 1981. During and after the marriage, the decedent was employed by Loparex LLC (Loparex). The decedent participated in the Loparex 401(k) Plan and had an account under that plan (the 401(k) account). On a \"Designation of Beneficiary Form,\" executed in November 1998, the decedent indicated that he was married to Betty and named her as the primary beneficiary to the 401(k) account. Fidelity Management Trust Company (FMTC) was the designated trustee of the 401(k) plan.\n¶ 4 In November 2003, the decedent and Betty's marriage was dissolved, pursuant to a judgment for dissolution of marriage entered by the circuit court of Cook County. That judgment incorporated a marital settlement agreement dated November 12, 2003 (the divorce decree) signed by the decedent and Betty. The divorce decree recites that Betty was represented by an attorney, but that the decedent had \"chosen to represent himself\" in the divorce.\n¶ 5 Paragraph 5 of the divorce decree provided:\n\"The parties agree that they have interests in several different retirement assets. The parties agree that each party shall retain sole ownership of their separate retirement assets, free and clear from any claim by the other party, as follows: The Wife [Betty] shall retain sole ownership of her IRA at Invesco and her 401(k) account * * * *. The Husband [the decedent] shall retain sole ownership of his IRA at Invesco and his 401(k) account at Fidelity. Each party warrants and represents that neither he nor she has any other interest in any other pension, IRA, 401(k) ESOP, or other retirement plan, except as may be specified above.\"\n¶ 6 The divorce decree subsequently stated that:\n\"Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the parties hereto does hereby forever relinquish, release, waive, and quitclaim to the other party hereto all property rights and claims which he or she now has or may hereafter have, as husband, wife, widow, widower or otherwise, or by reason of the marital relations now existing between the parties hereto or by virtue of any present or future law of any state or of the United States of America or any other country, in or to or against the property of the other party or his or her estate, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by such other party. Each of the parties hereto further covenants and agrees for himself and herself and his or her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that he or she will never at any time hereafter sue the other party or his or her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, for the purpose of enforcing any of the rights relinquished under this paragraph.\"\n¶ 7 The decedent died in March 2014. The decedent never executed a document changing the designation of Betty as the beneficiary to the 401(k) account.\n¶ 8 At the time of his death, the decedent had a \"Last Will and Testament\" dated December 1, 2013 (the will). In July 2014, the probate division of the circuit court of Cook County admitted the will to probate and appointed the executor.\n¶ 9 In August 2014, the executor informed Fidelity Brokerage Service LLC that the 401(k) account should pass to the decedent's estate (the estate), rather than to Betty. Loparex, as the 401(k) plan administrator, and FMTC, as trustee for the 401(k) account, determined that the estate was the proper beneficiary of the 401(k) account and caused the transfer of the 401(k) funds to a separate account for the benefit of the estate.\n¶ 10 On October 16, 2014, Betty filed a complaint for declaratory judgment as a supplemental proceeding in the decedent's probate case, alleging that she was the rightful beneficiary and was entitled to receive the funds from the 401(k) account. Loparex, as plan administrator, subsequently removed Betty's declaratory judgment action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the federal court). Loparex also filed an interpleader counterclaim in the federal court with respect to the 401(k) account. The executor filed an answer and counterclaim in the interpleader action, alleging that the estate was the proper beneficiary of the 401(k) plan under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. Â§ 1001 et seq. In addition, the executor also asserted state law claims against Betty, alleging breach of the divorce decree and seeking the imposition of a constructive trust for the benefit of the estate. The funds from the 401(k) account were deposited with the clerk of the federal court, subject to further order of that court.\n¶ 11 The executor and Betty filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the federal action. The executor argued that, under ERISA, the divorce decree constituted a \"qualified domestic relations order\" (QDRO) , such that the estate, rather than Betty, was the proper beneficiary of the proceeds of the 401(k) account. Alternatively, the executor argued that, even if the divorce decree was not a QDRO under ERISA, Betty could only receive the funds in the 401(k) account as a constructive trustee for the benefit of the estate. Betty's cross-motion argued that the divorce decree did not satisfy the requirements of a QDRO under ERISA, such that she remained the proper beneficiary of the 401(k) account, and that there was no basis to impose a constructive trust in favor of the estate.\n¶ 12 On November 1, 2016, the federal court entered an order in which it agreed that Betty was the rightful beneficiary under ERISA, but specifically declined to address the executor's claim for relief under state law. Cunningham v. Hebert, No. 14 C 9292, 2016 WL 6442180 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 1, 2016). The first portion of the federal court's order discussed \"Who the Rightful Beneficiary of the 401(k) Plan is Under ERISA.\" The federal court recognized that under ERISA, benefits may only be assigned or alienated through a QDRO, and that, \"[t]o qualify as a QDRO, a divorce decree must * * * 'create[ ] or recognize[ ] the existence of an alternate payee's right to * * * receive all or a portion of the benefits payable\" under a plan. Id . at * 3 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1), (d)(3)(B)(i)(I) (2012) ).\n¶ 13 The federal court rejected the executor's contention that the decedent could qualify as an \"alternate payee,\" finding that the decedent was not within the statutory definition of that term. See 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(k) (defining \"alternate payee\" to mean \"any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant\"). Because the divorce decree did not designate an \"alternate payee,\" the federal court concluded that it did not constitute a QDRO for purposes of the ERISA statute.\n¶ 14 In turn, the federal court concluded that the decedent's original designation naming Betty as the beneficiary of the 401(k) account, was unaffected by the divorce decree. The federal court also cited the United States Supreme Court's holding in Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan , 555 U.S. 285, 129 S.Ct. 865, 172 L.Ed.2d 662 (2009), for the proposition that a waiver contained in a non-QDRO divorce decree should be disregarded, if it conflicts with the beneficiary designation set forth in ERISA plan documents. The federal court noted that \"here, as in Kennedy, the divorce decree is inconsistent\" with the form designating Betty as the beneficiary of the 401(k). In turn, the federal court ruled that, under ERISA, \"the funds from the 401(k) account should have been distributed to Betty.\"\n¶ 15 Significant for purposes of this appeal, the federal court proceeded to note the executor's alternative contention that, even if Betty was the proper beneficiary under ERISA, she \"may only hold the proceeds as constructive trustee for the benefit of the estate because claiming the 401(k) fund is a violation of the divorce decree * * *.\" The federal court noted that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Kennedy \"left open the question whether a common law waiver has any effect on what should happen after the funds are distributed to the designated beneficiary.\" The federal court recognized that the issue had since been \"resolved in this circuit by N.L.R.B. v. HH3 Trucking, Inc. , 755 F.3d 468, 470-71 (7th Cir. 2014), holding that plan benefits, once paid to the beneficiary, are subject to legal process such as attachment or garnishment.\"\nÂ¶ 16 The federal court proceeded to conclude that it would be more appropriate for the circuit court of Cook County to determine whether, as a matter of state law, Betty was entitled to retain the funds: \"Although this court may assume supplemental jurisdiction of the Executor's request for imposition of a constructive trust, whether Betty has violated a decree entered in the Circuit Court of Cook County and if so what the consequence should be is not something this court should decide.\" Therefore, having decided the federal ERISA question, the federal court dismissed the executor's claim for breach of the divorce decree \"without prejudice to refiling in the Circuit Court of Cook County.\"\nÂ¶ 17 As suggested by the federal court's order, on November 15, 2016, the executor filed a \"Complaint in Supplemental Proceedings for Declaratory Judgment and Other Relief\" in the circuit court of Cook County (circuit court). The complaint contained two counts: a count for declaratory judgment (count 1) and a count for breach of the divorce decree (count 2). Both counts were premised on allegations that, under the divorce decree, Betty's beneficial interest in the 401(k) account was \"assigned, relinquished, waived, released, quitclaimed and/or disclaimed\" to the decedent's estate, that the estate \"retained sole ownership, property rights and interest in the 401(k) Funds,\" and that Betty was \"estopped from claiming any beneficial interest in the 401(k) funds.\"\n¶ 18 Count 1 alleged that, to prevent Betty's unjust enrichment, she could \"only act as constructive trustee\" for the benefit of the estate. Count 1 thus sought an order \"declaring and imposing a constructive trust on the 401(k) funds\" and ordering Betty to transfer the funds to the estate. Count 2 pleaded that any transfer of the 401(k) funds to Betty, or her use of the funds, would constitute a breach of the divorce decree. Count 2 sought a judgment against Betty \"in the amount of the 401(k) funds\" and, like count 1, also sought an order declaring a constructive trust, and directing Betty to turn over the 401(k) funds to the estate.\n¶ 19 On January 19, 2017, the circuit court entered an order prohibiting disbursement of the 401(k) funds pending its determination of the parties' rights. On January 31, 2017, the parties filed a Joint and Stipulated Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and Documents. The executor and Betty subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n¶ 20 The executor's motion for summary judgment argued that the decedent's and Betty's \"intentions as to their respective retirement assets are unequivocal and self-evident in the Divorce Decree.\" The executor asserted that the divorce decree was a binding contract, in which Betty \"relinquished, released and waived\" any interest in the 401(k) account. Alternatively, the executor argued that entry of the divorce decree \"automatically revoked\" Betty's status as the beneficiary of the 401(k) account, by operation of the Illinois Trusts and Dissolutions of Marriage Act (TDMA) . 760 ILCS 35/1 (West 2016). Thus, the executor argued that Betty could not retain the 401(k) funds \"other than [as] constructive trustee for the benefit of the Estate.\"\n¶ 21 Betty's motion for summary judgment first argued that count 1 of the executor's complaint was barred by the doctrine of res judicata , because the federal court had already \"ruled that Betty * * * was entitled to the 401(k) proceeds.\" Betty additionally urged that summary judgment in her favor was mandated by ERISA and the United States Supreme Court's decision in Egelhoff v. Egelhoff , 532 U.S. 141, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001) (holding that ERISA pre-empted a Washington statute providing that a divorce automatically revoked a prior designation of a spouse as the beneficiary). Betty asserted that, under Egelhoff , she was entitled to summary judgment because she was the last named beneficiary to the 401(k) account.\n¶ 22 With respect to count 2 of the executor's complaint, Betty's motion argued that the divorce decree could not waive her interest in the 401(k) plan under ERISA, citing Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings & Investment Plan , 555 U.S. 285, 129 S.Ct. 865, 172 L.Ed.2d 662 (2009). Betty otherwise argued that the language of the divorce decree was insufficient to waive her interest in the 401(k), as the divorce decree contained only \"generic waivers,\" but neither she or the decedent \"specifically waive[d] their interest in specific assets or agree[d] to terminate their interests as a beneficiary.\" Betty's motion otherwise claimed that it was evident that the decedent intended for Betty \"to remain as the rightful beneficiary,\" because he did not change the beneficiary designation for the 401(k) after the divorce. Betty and the executor subsequently filed responses to each other's cross-motions for summary judgment, as well as reply briefs.\nÂ¶ 23 On July 25, 2017, the circuit court entered an order in which it granted the executor's motion for summary judgment and denied Betty's motion. The court first rejected Betty's claim that res judicata barred count 1 of the executor's complaint. The circuit court recognized that the federal court had decided only \"the ERISA\nissue,\" but that the federal court \"specifically declined to assume supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims, including the Executor's counterclaim for a declaratory judgment.\" Thus, the circuit court found there had been \"no final judgment on the merits of the declaratory action,\" and so res judicata did not apply.\n¶ 24 Next, the circuit court agreed with the executor's contention that the TDMA automatically revoked Betty's beneficial interest. The court found that the \"401(k) plan documents * * * make clear that the 401(k) in this case is a trust\" that was governed by the TDMA. The court concluded that, under section 1 of the TDMA ( 760 ILCS 35/1 (West 2016) ) Betty's interest in the 401(k) \"was automatically extinguished upon entry of the Divorce Decree.\"\nÂ¶ 25 As an independent basis for ruling in favor of the executor, the circuit court additionally found that, \"even if Betty's interest had not been automatically extinguished under the TDMA, her interest was extinguished by the clear and specific terms of the Divorce Decree.\" The court reasoned:\n\"[t]he Divorce Decree clearly expressed Betty's intent to waive any interest in the Loparex 401(k). Both Betty and [the decedent] held separate retirement accounts during their marriage. The Divorce Decree specifically listed each account and provided that each party would keep his or her own accounts. As part of this provision, the Divorce Decree listed [the decedent's] interest in 'his 401(k) account at Fidelity,' specifically provided that [the decedent] shall 'retain sole ownership' of his separate retirement assets 'free and clear of any claim' by Betty, and contained waiver and release language. Therefore, Betty's interest in the Loparex 401(k) was extinguished upon entry of the Divorce Decree.\"\n¶ 26 On these grounds, the circuit court found that \"Betty's interest in the Loparex 401(k) was extinguished,\" imposed a constructive trust on the 401(k) funds, and ordered Betty to turn the funds over to the executor. The circuit court specified that this determination was a final and appealable order.\n¶ 27 On August 23, 2017, Betty filed a timely notice of appeal. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction. Ill. S. Ct. R. 303(a) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n¶ 28 ANALYSIS\n¶ 29 On appeal, Betty asserts three lines of argument challenging the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to the executor. First, she contends that count 1 of the executor's complaint was barred by operation of res judicata . Second, she claims that the court erred in finding that the TDMA operated to extinguish her interest in the 401(k) account. Third, she disputes the circuit court's independent conclusion that her interest in the 401(k) account was waived or otherwise extinguished by the terms of the divorce decree.\n¶ 30 We first reject Betty's claim that res judicata barred the executor's request for a declaratory judgment in count 1. Betty explicitly limits her res judicata argument to count 1; she does not suggest that count 2 was barred, as she recognizes that the federal court's order specified that the executor could assert a claim for breach of the divorce decree in state court. Betty states that res judicata applies to count 1 because \"the claims asserted in the previous declaratory judgment action [in federal court] and the current Declaratory Judgment Action arise from a single group of operative facts.\" She urges that, since the federal court \"denied [the executor's] request for declaratory relief,\" the executor could not make a similar claim for declaratory relief in the circuit court.\n¶ 31 \"The doctrine of res judicata provides that a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction bars any subsequent action between the same parties or their privies on the same cause of action. [Citation.] Res judicata bars not only what was actually decided in the first action but also whatever could have been decided. [Citation.] Three requirements must be satisfied for res judicata to apply: (1) a final judgment on the merits has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) an identity of cause of action exists; and (3) the parties or their privies are identical in both actions. [Citation.]\" Hudson v. City of Chicago , 228 Ill. 2d 462, 467, 321 Ill.Dec. 306, 889 N.E.2d 210 (2008).\n¶ 32 Illinois courts have held that, when a federal court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims, res judicata will not apply to bar subsequent litigation of a state-law claim in state court. Nowak v. St. Rita High School , 197 Ill. 2d 381, 393-94, 258 Ill.Dec. 782, 757 N.E.2d 471 (2001) (\"[b]y declining jurisdiction over the plaintiff's pendent state claim * * * the district court in effect reserved plaintiff's right to pursue the matter in state court.\"); Schandelmeier-Bartels v. Chicago Park District , 2015 IL App (1st) 133356, ¶¶ 28-31, 389 Ill.Dec. 451, 26 N.E.3d 541 (federal court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claim did not implicate res judicata ).\n¶ 33 In this case, the federal court decided a single issue of federal law to conclude that, under ERISA, Betty was entitled to distribution of the 401(k) account by the plan administrator. However, the federal court expressly declined to decide the executor's claim that, as a matter of state law, it was unjust for Betty to retain the 401(k) funds after their initial distribution. Indeed, the federal court expressly indicated that the executor could re-file an action in the circuit court of Cook County to pursue the 401(k) funds under state law. Accordingly, we do not find that the federal court's order was a \"final judgment on the merits\" that could support application of res judicata .\n¶ 34 Having rejected her res judicata argument, we turn to address Betty's challenges to the circuit court's independent conclusions that (1) pursuant to the TDMA, her interest in the 401(k) was extinguished upon her divorce, and that (2) in any event, Betty waived her interest in the 401(k) under the explicit terms of the divorce decree. Significantly, the circuit court indicated that these were independent, alternative grounds for granting summary judgment to the executor. At oral argument, Betty's counsel conceded that, regardless of the propriety of the trial court's holding regarding the TDMA, we may affirm the trial court, if we agree that the divorce decree constituted an explicit waiver of her interest in the 401(k) account.\n¶ 35 With respect to the trial court's holding regarding the TDMA, Betty's sole argument in her opening appellate brief is that \"ERISA supercedes and pre-empts\" the TDMA, relying on Egelhoff v. Egelhoff , 532 U.S. 141, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001). The executor's brief responds that (1) Betty has \"waived\" her TDMA argument and (2) in any event, the trial court properly held that the TDMA operated to extinguish her interest in the 401(k). The executor contends that Illinois courts have previously applied the TDMA to retirement accounts, relying primarily upon In re Estate of Davis , 225 Ill. App. 3d 998, 168 Ill.Dec. 40, 589 N.E.2d 154 (1992). That decision held that a decedent's pre-dissolution designation of his wife as the beneficiary of his individual retirement account (IRA) was revoked pursuant to the TDMA upon the judicial termination of the marriage. Id. at 1004, 168 Ill.Dec. 40, 589 N.E.2d 154. Davis further held that, as the decedent \"must be charged with the knowledge that the IRA trust agreement was to be construed in accordance with Illinois law,\" his failure to redesignate his former spouse as beneficiary after the divorce \"must be viewed as an intent not to renew that beneficiary designation.\" (Emphasis in original.) Id. at 1005, 168 Ill.Dec. 40, 589 N.E.2d 154. In her reply brief and at oral argument, Betty disputed the applicability of Davis ' holding regarding an IRA, to the 401(k) account at issue in this case.\n¶ 36 However, we determine that we need not decide the applicability of the TDMA to resolve this appeal. First, we note that Betty did not raise her preemption argument in the circuit court. Although the executor's motion cited the TDMA as a basis for granting summary judgment in its favor, Betty's responding arguments in the circuit court never claimed that the TDMA was preempted by ERISA. Rather, her circuit court responses only argued that the TDMA did not apply because the \"401(k) proceeds were not held in trust.\"\n¶ 37 \"Generally, arguments not raised before the circuit court are forfeited and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. [Citation.]\" Mabry v. Boler , 2012 IL App (1st) 111464, ¶ 15, 362 Ill.Dec. 1, 972 N.E.2d 716. \"This court may deem any arguments not raised in the trial court as waived or forfeit[ed] on appeal.\" Sheth v. SAB Tool Supply Co. , 2013 IL App (1st) 110156, ¶ 59, 371 Ill.Dec. 550, 990 N.E.2d 738. We conclude that Betty's preemption argument regarding the TDMA is forfeited.\n¶ 38 Further, we need not decide whether the TDMA applies to the 401(k) account at issue in this case. This is because the circuit court additionally determined that-wholly apart from operation of the TDMA-the terms of the divorce decree waived Betty's interest in the 401(k). As set forth below, we agree with the circuit court's conclusion on that issue, which independently supports its judgment in favor of the executor.\n¶ 39 In challenging the circuit court's conclusion that her interest in the 401(k) account was extinguished by the waiver language of the divorce decree, Betty first suggests that the issue is governed by the United States Supreme Court's decision in Kennedy , 555 U.S. 285, 129 S.Ct. 865, 172 L.Ed.2d 662 (2009). Betty also cites three decisions from our court, each of which is at least 27 years old, to argue that the divorce decree did not extinguish her interest in the 401(k). See Leahy v. Leahy-Schuett , 211 Ill. App. 3d 394, 155 Ill.Dec. 894, 570 N.E.2d 407 (1991) ; Williams v. Gatling , 186 Ill. App. 3d 21, 134 Ill.Dec. 121, 542 N.E.2d 121 (1989) ; O'Toole v. Central Laborers' Pension & Welfare Funds , 12 Ill. App. 3d 995, 299 N.E.2d 392 (1973).\nBetty otherwise claims \"there is no provision in the [divorce decree] that terminates [her] beneficial interest in any of decedent's assets.\" Betty recognizes that \"[a]n expectancy interest may be terminated by a divorce decree\" if there is a \"clear expression of the spouse's surrender of that interest,\" yet she claims that, in this case, she \"did not waive or surrender her interest in the 401k proceeds.\" For the following reasons, we reject her arguments and find that the divorce decree's explicit waiver terminated her interest in the decedent's 401(k) account.\n¶ 40 First, we find that Betty's reliance on Kennedy is misplaced. Kennedy held that, to comply with ERISA, a plan administrator must abide by the plan documents and distribute pension benefits to the former spouse who is named as the decedent's beneficiary, even when the former spouse \"purported to waive her entitlement by a federal common law waiver embodied in a divorce decree that was not a QDRO.\" Kennedy , 555 U.S. at 288, 129 S.Ct. 865. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that the \"plan administrator did its statutory ERISA duty by paying the benefits to [decedent's former spouse] in conformity with the plan documents,\" notwithstanding the divorce decree. Id. at 299-300, 129 S.Ct. 865.\n¶ 41 However, Kennedy expressly did not determine whether a named beneficiary is necessarily entitled to retain the proceeds after their initial distribution by an ERISA plan administrator, or if another party may still assert a claim to the proceeds on other grounds. Indeed, in a footnote, the United States Supreme Court declined to \"express any view as to whether the Estate could have brought an action in state or federal court against [decedent's former spouse] to obtain the benefits after they were distributed.\" Id. at 299 n. 10, 129 S.Ct. 865. Similarly, in this case, the federal court's order recognized that: \" Kennedy left open the question whether a common law waiver has any effect on what should happen after the funds are distributed to the designated beneficiary.\"\nÂ¶ 42 Accordingly, in this case, the federal court applied Kennedy when it determined that Betty was the rightful beneficiary pursuant to ERISA. However, also consistent with Kennedy, the federal court declined to address whether Betty was entitled to retain the 401(k) funds pursuant to the divorce decree, and explicitly permitted the executor to pursue its state law claims in the circuit court of Cook County. Thus, Kennedy did not preclude the executor from claiming a breach of the divorce decree to seek recovery of the 401(k) funds for the estate.\n¶ 43 Having rejected Betty's reliance on Kennedy , we turn to her contention that the divorce decree did not contain a \"clear expression\" of her intent to waive any interest in the 401(k) account. This issue is essentially one of contractual interpretation. \"It is well settled that the rules of contract construction are applicable to the interpretation of a marital settlement agreement and that a court's primary objective is to give effect to the intent of the parties. [Citation.] Where the language of the agreement is clear and its meaning is unambiguous, intent must be determined solely from the agreement's language and courts must give that language such effect. [Citation.]\" In re Marriage of Farrell and Howe , 2017 IL App (1st) 170611, Â¶ 12, 420 Ill.Dec. 431, 96 N.E.3d 516. \"This court reviews a circuit court's interpretation of a marital settlement agreement de novo .\" Id.\n¶ 44 Our court has articulated a two-part inquiry to assess the enforceability of a divorce decree provision that purports to waive an expectancy interest in an asset:\n\"A dissolution agreement may extinguish a divorced spouse's expectancy interest * * * if the agreement includes a clear expression of the spouse's waiver of that interest. [Citations.] To determine the effect of a waiver, two factors must be considered: (1) whether the asset in dispute was specifically listed as a marital asset and awarded to a spouse; and (2) whether the waiver provision contained in the settlement agreement specifically states that the parties are waiving any expectancy or beneficial interest in that asset. [Citations.] This court's review of the interpretation of a waiver provision included in a contractual agreement is de novo .\" In re Marriage of Velasquez , 295 Ill. App. 3d 350, 353, 229 Ill.Dec. 852, 692 N.E.2d 841 (1998).\n¶ 45 Although the assets at issue in Velasquez (a land trust and insurance proceeds) were different in nature from the 401(k) account in this case, we find that that two-factor inquiry outlined in that decision is applicable. The first part of that inquiry is clearly satisfied here, as the 401(k) account was explicitly awarded to the decedent. The divorce decree specified that \"each party shall retain sole ownership of their separate retirement assets free and clear from any claim by the other party,\" including that decedent \"shall retain sole ownership of his * * * 401(k) account at Fidelity.\"\n¶ 46 We next consider the second part of the inquiry-whether the divorce decree \"specifically states that the parties are waiving any expectancy or beneficial interest\" in the disputed asset. Velasquez , 295 Ill. App. 3d at 353, 229 Ill.Dec. 852, 692 N.E.2d 841. We recognize that the waiver language in the divorce decree does not contain the exact terms \"expectancy\" or \"beneficial.\" Nevertheless, as our primary concern is to discern the parties' intent, we find that the divorce decree's waiver provision is unambiguously broad and prospective, encompassing all future as well as present property rights: \"[E]ach of the parties hereto does hereby forever relinquish, release, waive, and quitclaim to the other party all property rights and claims which he or she now has or may hereafter have * * * in or to or against the property of the other party or his or her estate, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by such other party.\" (Emphasis added.)\n¶ 47 Notably, we enforced similarly broad waiver language in Robson v. Electrical Contractors Ass'n Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust of Chicago , 312 Ill. App. 3d 374, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692 (1999), a dispute regarding a decedent's pension trust for which the decedent's ex-wife (Nancy) was named the beneficiary during the marriage. Id. at 376, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692. Upon the divorce, Nancy's counsel prepared a marital dissolution judgment stating that the marital portion of the pension would be divided equally between the former spouses. Id. The dissolution judgment included a provision that specified:\n\" 'Each of the parties' rights and claims with regard to dower, homestead and all other property rights and claims which they may have or hereafter have, as husband, wife, widower, widow, or otherwise, by reason of the marital relationship * * * in and to, or against the property of the other or his or her estate, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by such other party is hereby terminated.' \" Id. at 377, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692.\nThe dissolution judgment further called for entry of a \"Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)\" that \"establishe[d] Nancy's one-half interest in the marital portion\" of the pension. Id. Following the decedent's death, Nancy filed a complaint seeking a declaration that she was the owner of all the pension benefits. The trial court granted summary judgment in Nancy's favor, finding that the dissolution judgment and QDRO \"had not effectuated 'a sufficiently clear surrender of' \" decedent's death benefits. Id. at 379, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692.\n¶ 48 On appeal, our court reversed, finding that Nancy was \"not entitled to any survivorship rights in the 50% of [decedent]'s pension benefits held in trust for him.\" Id. at 381, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692. We noted that the dissolution judgment specified an equal division of the marital portion of the pension, such that the decedent became the owner of 50% of the pension trust benefits. Id. at 382, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692. We also stated that: \"in straightforward, express terms, the dissolution judgment terminated 'all property rights and claims which [decedent and Nancy] may have or hereafter have * * * in or to or against the property of the other or his or her estate * * *.' \" Id. (noting that the \"waiver provision, although not specifically mentioning the pension trust, does specifically reference the property owned by each party.\" (Emphasis in original) ). After further noting that the terms should be \"construed most strictly against the wife\" because they were drafted by her counsel, we concluded that there was \"a specific termination of Nancy's rights and claims, survivorship or otherwise, in the remaining one-half portion of [decedent's] pension trust.\" Id. at 382-83, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692.\n¶ 49 In her reply brief and at oral argument, Betty noted factual differences between Robson and the instant case, namely: (1) a QDRO was entered in Robson , whereas the federal court in this case determined that the divorce decree was not a QDRO, and (2) the disputed asset at issue in Robson was not a 401(k) account. However, we conclude that those factual distinctions do not bear upon the relevant issues of the construction and enforceability of the waiver provision. In that regard, we find Robson to be instructive.\n¶ 50 Similar to Robson , the divorce decree in this case stated, in clear and unequivocal terms, that Betty and the decedent \"forever relinquish[ed], release[d], waive[d], and quitclaim[ed] * * * all property rights and claims which he or she now has or may hereafter have * * * in or to or against the property of the other party or his or her estate, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by such other party.\" We find that this broad waiver language unequivocally encompassed all property rights of any nature, including the beneficial property interest in the 401(k) at issue in this case. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how the waiver could have been worded more broadly.\n¶ 51 At oral argument, Betty's counsel was asked to explain her position that the divorce decree's language was insufficiently specific to waive the property interest at issue in this case. That is, counsel was asked to articulate what other wording could have been included to encompass the beneficial interest in the 401(k) account at issue. Betty's counsel suggested that the divorce decree should have additionally specified that the former spouses waived their \"beneficial interests\" in each other's property, had they intended to waive such property rights.\n¶ 52 We reject Betty's suggestion that more specific language was necessary in order for the divorce decree's waiver to apply to her interest in the 401(k) account. Such language would be superfluous, given the undeniably broad waiver language already contained in the divorce decree. The divorce decree waived \"all property rights and claims which [Betty and the decedent] now ha[ve] or may hereafter have .\" (Emphasis added.) These terms are indisputably broad on their face, and we are bound to accord them their plain meaning. The use of the term \"all,\" especially combined with the prospective phrase \"may hereafter have,\" undoubtedly encompasses all types of property rights that may come into existence; this necessarily includes beneficial or expectancy property interests.\n¶ 53 In light of this overwhelmingly broad language, we reject Betty's suggestion that the divorce decree was insufficiently specific to waive beneficial interests. Rather, we find that the divorce decree unambiguously expressed the parties' intent to waive all present and future interests in each others' property, including Betty's interest in the decedent's 401(k) account. Moreover, this conclusion is entirely consistent with the divorce decree's earlier statements that the decedent and Betty \"shall retain sole ownership of their separate retirement assets, free and clear from any claim by the other party\" and that the decedent \"shall retain sole ownership\" of the 401(k) account.\n¶ 54 Based on the clear and explicit waiver language of the divorce decree, we agree with the trial court that it terminated Betty's interest in the 401(k) account proceeds, independent of ERISA or the TDMA. Upon that sole contractual basis, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County. We reiterate that our holding is narrow and limited, as discussed. We need not, and we do not, decide the additional questions regarding application of the TDMA and ERISA that were briefed and argued. We simply hold that, under the explicit language of the divorce decree, Betty waived her interest in the 401(k) account. On this basis, we agree with the trial court that the executor was entitled to summary judgment, and that Betty's cross-motion was properly denied. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County.\n¶ 55 Affirmed.\nPresiding Justice Delort and Justice Connors concurred in the judgment, with opinion.\nUnder section 1056 (d) of the ERISA statute, benefits under a pension plan may not be assigned or alienated by a domestic relations order unless \"the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1), (3)(A). Section 1056(d)(3) sets forth the requirements for \"qualified domestic relations order,\" including that it must \"create[ ] or recognize the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1056 (d)(3)(B)(i)(I).\nThe TDMA provides, in relevant part: \"Unless the governing instrument or the judgment of judicial termination of marriage expressly provides otherwise, judicial termination of the marriage of the settlor of a trust revokes every provision which is revocable by the settlor pertaining to the settlor's former spouse in a trust instrument or amendment thereto executed by the settlor before the entry of the judgment of judicial termination of the settlor's marriage, and any such trust shall be administered and construed as if the settlor's former spouse had died upon entry of the judgment of judicial termination of the settlor's marriage.\" 760 ILCS 35/1(a) (West 2016).\nMoreover, we note that both counts of the executor's complaint requested the same relief, including imposition of a constructive trust and an order directing Betty to turn over the 401(k) funds to the decedent's estate. Thus, even if we were to agree with Betty that count 1 was somehow barred by res judicata , it would not preclude the trial court from granting the same relief under count 2.\nIn light of our conclusion that Betty's preemption argument is forfeited, we need not reach the executor's contentions that the preemption argument is otherwise barred by the doctrines of law of the case and collateral estoppel.\nThe three additional decisions cited by Betty to dispute the efficacy of the divorce decree waiver predate both Velasquez and Robson , and we find them to be non-controlling. See Williams v. Gatling , 186 Ill. App. 3d 21, 134 Ill.Dec. 121, 542 N.E.2d 121 (1989) ; Leahy v. Leahy-Schuett , 211 Ill. App. 3d 394, 155 Ill.Dec. 894, 570 N.E.2d 407 (1991) ; O'Toole v. Central Laborers' Pension & Welfare Funds , 12 Ill. App. 3d 995, 299 N.E.2d 392 (1973).\nAlthough we find that the waiver is explicit on its face, we also note that, similar to Robson , the divorce decree in this case reflects that it was drafted by Betty's counsel, whereas the decedent was unrepresented. Thus, its terms are construed strictly against Betty. Robson , 312 Ill. App. 3d at 383, 245 Ill.Dec. 245, 727 N.E.2d 692 (\"when a dissolution judgment is drafted by the wife's counsel and the husband is unrepresented, as here, the terms of the dissolution judgment are to be construed most strictly against the wife.\").",

Over two years later and after the dissolution petition had been set for trial, John filed a counterpetition for legal separation in the domestic relations division of the circuit court of Cook County along with a complaint in the law division against Ellen (among others) alleging that the defendants schemed to divest John of his interest in certain marital property by placing the property into two trusts. John's motion to consolidate his law division complaint into Ellen's dissolution petition was denied, as was his motion to stay the dissolution proceedings until the law division suit was resolved or, alternatively, to amend his counterpetition for legal separation to include his law division claims.\n¶ 2 On appeal, John challenges the rulings on his motions to consolidate and to amend and also argues that the trial court erred in granting the petition for dissolution without apportioning the allegedly misappropriated marital property. John further argues that the trial court erred in crediting Ellen for amounts John incurred in attorney fees in excess of the fees Ellen incurred. Finding no error, we affirm.\n¶ 3 BACKGROUND\n¶ 4 John and Ellen were married in 1986 and had three adult emancipated children at the time Ellen petitioned for dissolution of their marriage on September 11, 2013. At the time the petition was filed, Ellen was 55 years old and John was 70. During their almost 30-year marriage, John was a public school teacher in Chicago, while Ellen founded American Food Technologies, Inc. (Amfotek), a manufacturer of sugar-based blended beverages for convenience stores and quick-service retailers. Ellen also formed Mariah Partners, LLC (Mariah Partners), the owner of a mixed-use office and industrial building in Tinley Park, Illinois, where Amfotek is headquartered.\n¶ 5 On December 15, 2015, following over two years of discovery, the court set the matter for trial over several dates in July 2016 and ordered that discovery be closed on May 13, 2016. On February 26, 2016, John filed a counterpetition for legal separation. (As a Roman Catholic, John was opposed to divorce.) One week later, on March 4, 2016, John filed a complaint in the law division seeking millions of dollars in punitive and compensatory damages from Ellen and eight additional defendants. The complaint, in six causes of action, generally alleged a conspiracy between Ellen and the defendants to illegally transfer marital property into the John P. Reidy Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT) and the Ellen J. Reidy Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT), both created in 2012, before Ellen filed her petition for dissolution. According to John, the creation of the trusts reduced the marital estate and ultimately would give him a smaller property distribution and maintenance award in the dissolution proceedings.\n¶ 6 The corpus of the QPRT was a Naples, Florida, condominium that John and Ellen purchased in 2006. The buyer named on the deed and in the purchase documents was John P. Reidy, as trustee of the John P. Reidy Trust, Amended and Restated, January 26, 2006. According to John's complaint, the QPRT stripped him of ownership of the condo and left him with a 10-year life estate at the age of 69. Upon expiration of the 10-year term, the property would pass to Ellen and their three children. The final draft of the QPRT, which John alleged he was \"tricked\" into signing in December 2012, also contained a provision that Ellen would remain a beneficiary of the trust in the event she and John divorced. The GRAT contained 30% of Ellen's interest in Amfotek and 39% of her interest in Mariah Partners. John alleged that he first learned of the existence of the GRAT during discovery in the dissolution proceedings.\n¶ 7 On April 13, 2016, the court granted John's petition for interim and prospective attorney fees and costs, ordering Ellen to pay John's past due and prospective attorney fees until further order. The court's order also provided that all such payments would be deemed advances from the marital estate. Finally, the court concluded that the assessment of the interim fee award was \"without prejudice to any final allocation and without prejudice to any claim or right of either party or counsel.\"\n¶ 8 On April 28, 2016, less than two months before trial was set to begin, John filed a motion to consolidate his law division complaint into the petition for dissolution, arguing that consolidation would further judicial economy and avoid possibly conflicting results. According to John, he filed the motion to consolidate in both the law division and the domestic relations division of the circuit court, but the notice of motion appears only in the electronic docket of the law division case, not the docket in the dissolution case pending in the domestic relations division. The motion itself only bears the stamp of the law division.\n¶ 9 Pursuant to Cook County Circuit Court General Order No. 12.1, the motion was heard by the law division's assignment judge, who hears motions for consolidation pending in different divisions of the trial court. Cook County Cir. Ct. G.O. 12.1 (Feb. 1, 1964). Ellen and several codefendants in the law division case opposed the motion on the basis that they would be prejudiced by the addition of new claims in the dissolution proceedings and the attendant delay that would follow in a case that had already been pending for 2½ years. The court agreed and denied John's motion on June 23, 2016. The order denying the motion for consolidation, while including the caption for the domestic relations case, appears only in the electronic docket of the law division case.\n¶ 10 The next day, on June 24, 2016, John changed his strategy and filed a motion in the domestic relations division to stay the dissolution proceedings pending resolution of the law division complaint or, alternatively, for leave to amend his counterpetition for legal separation to add the claims asserted in his law division complaint. Again, John cited reasons of judicial economy and the prevention of conflicting results as the basis for his motion, while Ellen argued she would be prejudiced by a delay in the dissolution proceedings. The court denied John's motion, finding that John could have sought leave to amend his counterpetition earlier and that Ellen was entitled to dissolution of their marriage without further delay.\n¶ 11 Ellen also filed a motion in limine asking the court to bar John from introducing allegations contained in the law division complaint at trial. John, through counsel, joined in that motion and asked for an agreed order that prohibited both parties from eliciting evidence or testimony relating to the law division claims. The court ultimately granted the motion in limine .\n¶ 12 Trial took place on July 11-14 and July 18, 2016, with much of the evidence presented via stipulation. John and Ellen were the only witnesses to testify.\n¶ 13 In August 2016, while the matter was under advisement, Ellen challenged $400,000 in interim fees sought by John and filed a motion to reopen proofs to require John to explain the basis for his $400,000 fee request. The motion further asked the court to hold a hearing on the reasonableness of those fees prior to making a final allocation. The court denied Ellen's motion on September 27, 2016, but ordered the parties to submit affidavits attesting to the amount of fees and costs they had incurred. The affidavits reflected that as of September 30, 2016, Ellen had paid fees and costs of $728,901, while John had paid $1,357,708.\n¶ 14 The court ultimately granted the petition for dissolution on December 20, 2016. Per the agreed motion in limine , the court's order did not allocate or refer to the property in the QPRT and GRAT but allocated the parties' business interests (primarily consisting of 70% of Amfotek and 61% of Mariah Partners) and awarded John 45% and Ellen 55%. With regard to attorney fees, the court ordered that the amount John paid in fees in excess of the amount Ellen paid \"shall be used as a credit in the calculation of the note owed from Ellen to John as part of the buy-out of the business interests.\" The court did not award either party contribution for outstanding fees as it found that each party had sufficient assets to pay their own fees.\n¶ 15 John timely appealed on January 5, 2017. Before briefing commenced, in March 2017, Brigid Reidy and Maura Baskovich, defendants in the law division case in their capacity as trustees of the QPRT and GRAT, respectively, moved to intervene and filed a motion to dismiss a portion of the appeal. This court allowed their motion to intervene, but on October 2, 2017, the circuit court dismissed John's law division complaint against Brigid and Maura. On November 30, 2017, after John had filed his appellant's brief, Brigid and Maura moved to withdraw their intervention and their motion, which we allowed. They are no longer parties to this appeal.\n¶ 16 ANALYSIS\n¶ 17 At the outset, we address both parties' contention that the other's brief violated Illinois Supreme Court Rule 341 (eff. Nov. 1, 2017), which governs the content of appellate briefs. Specifically, Ellen contends that John's opening brief omitted facts that were unfavorable to him in violation of Rule 341(h)(6) and that John failed to cite the record throughout his argument in violation of Rule 341(h)(7). Id. John, in turn, argues that Ellen's brief failed to conform to Rule 341(h)(6) by injecting argument into the statement of facts. Id.\n¶ 18 Notably, the rules of procedure governing appellate briefs are rules rather than suggestions. Rosestone Investments, LLC v. Garner , 2013 IL App (1st) 123422, ¶ 18, 377 Ill.Dec. 616, 2 N.E.3d 532. In other words, failure to comply with supreme court rules is not an inconsequential matter, and we may strike a brief that fails to substantially conform to the pertinent rules. Hall v. Naper Gold Hospitality LLC , 2012 IL App (2d) 111151, ¶ 7, 360 Ill.Dec. 885, 969 N.E.2d 930. But where violations of the rules do not hinder our review, we may simply disregard the noncompliant material. Szczesniak v. CJC Auto Parts, Inc. , 2014 IL App (2d) 130636, ¶ 8, 386 Ill.Dec. 723, 21 N.E.3d 486. This is the case here.\n¶ 19 We agree that John's brief omits some salient facts, most importantly, the fact that the dissolution case had been set for trial at the time John filed his counterpetition for legal separation and law division complaint. Likewise, Ellen's statement of facts veers closely into argument on occasion. But neither of these violations impair our review, and we decline to accept either parties' invitation to strike the other's brief.\n¶ 20 As a final procedural matter, we address John's contention that Ellen cited a document included in the appendix that was not made part of the record. Specifically, in explaining the process that led to Brigid and Maura's motion to withdraw intervention in this appeal, Ellen cited the circuit court's order dismissing them from the law division case. While a party may not rely on matters outside the record to support its position on appeal ( Keener v. City of Herrin , 235 Ill. 2d 338, 346, 335 Ill.Dec. 888, 919 N.E.2d 913 (2009) ), this order was in fact included in the supplemental record Brigid and Maura filed simultaneously with their motion to withdraw. In any event, given that the trial court's dismissal order as to Brigid and Maura has no relevance to the issues in the instant appeal, we will not consider it.\n¶ 21 Turning to the merits, we begin by addressing John's challenge to the trial court's order denying his motion to consolidate his law division complaint into the dissolution petition pending in the domestic relations division. Ellen argues that we lack jurisdiction over an appeal from this order, and we agree.\n¶ 22 This court has jurisdiction over appeals from all final judgments entered in the circuit court, as well as those \"prior nonfinal rulings and final but nonappealable orders that produced the judgment.\" In re Marriage of King , 336 Ill. App. 3d 83, 86, 270 Ill.Dec. 540, 783 N.E.2d 115 (2002). Neither party contends that the order denying consolidation was a final judgment, but John argues that it was an underlying nonfinal order in the judgment of dissolution. We disagree: the denial of the motion was a step in the procedural progression of the law division case, in which the trial court has not yet rendered a final judgment, and which is not on appeal.\n¶ 23 John correctly notes that pursuant to circuit court rule, he was required to file his motion to consolidate in the law division, given that the motion asked to consolidate two cases pending in different divisions of the circuit court. See Cook County Cir. Ct. G.O. 12.1 (Feb. 1, 1964); see also La Salle National Bank v. Helry Corp. , 136 Ill. App. 3d 897, 905, 91 Ill.Dec. 472, 483 N.E.2d 958 (1985). But the fact that the motion itself (and the order denying it) was filed and entered only in the law division case is not the basis for our holding. The substance of the motion pertained only to the law division case. John asked the court to transfer his law division complaint from the law division to the domestic relations division and consolidate his law division action into the dissolution proceedings. The motion sought relief pertaining only to John's law division claims; John wanted to litigate those claims in a different division of the circuit court. Because the motion did not seek relief with respect to the dissolution proceedings, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the order denying the motion to consolidate in this appeal from the dissolution judgment.\n¶ 24 But even assuming we could characterize the denial of the motion to consolidate as a procedural step in the dissolution case, we find no error in the court's decision. A motion to consolidate should be allowed as an \"aid to convenience\" if it can be done \"without prejudice to a substantial right.\" 735 ILCS 5/2-1006 (West 2014). Consolidation is proper when the cases involve almost identical issues and the failure to consolidate could result in inconsistent judgments. Charles v. Gore , 248 Ill. App. 3d 441, 446-47, 187 Ill.Dec. 963, 618 N.E.2d 554 (1993). The trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to grant a motion to consolidate, and we will not disturb the trial court's determination absent an abuse of that discretion. Turner v. Williams , 326 Ill. App. 3d 541, 546, 260 Ill.Dec. 804, 762 N.E.2d 70 (2001).\n¶ 25 Here, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying John's motion on the basis that Ellen and the defendants would face prejudice if the motion was granted. The court noted that consolidation would require a substantial continuance to allow the parties to complete discovery, as it added eight new defendants and pled six causes of action. Given that the dissolution proceeding had been pending for over 2½ years and was set for trial in less than two months, the untimeliness of the motion was not an unreasonable basis for the trial court's decision to deny consolidation. See Peck v. Peck , 16 Ill. 2d 268, 275, 157 N.E.2d 249 (1959) (application for consolidation must be timely).\n¶ 26 John also challenges the trial court's refusal to allow him to amend his counterpetition in the dissolution proceedings to include his newly-filed law division claims. Although we do have jurisdiction to consider this claimed error, we reject it largely for the same reasons articulated above. We review a denial of leave to amend a pleading for an abuse of discretion. Johnson v. Stojan Law Office, P.C. , 2018 IL App (3d) 170003, ¶ 18, 419 Ill.Dec. 912, 95 N.E.3d 33. A trial court abuses its discretion only when no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court. Trettenero v. Police Pension Fund , 333 Ill. App. 3d 792, 801, 267 Ill.Dec. 468, 776 N.E.2d 840 (2002). The court did not abuse its discretion in denying John's motion to amend his counterpetition for legal separation to add new claims asserted in the law division complaint. See Taylor, Bean, & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. v. Cocroft , 2018 IL App (1st) 170969, ¶ 46 (\"The trial court has broad discretion in deciding a motion to amend pleadings prior to the entry of final judgment.\"). The four factors we consider in determining whether the court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend are (1) whether the proposed amendment would cure a defect in the pleading, (2) whether other parties would sustain prejudice or surprise by virtue of the amendment, (3) whether the amendment is timely, and (4) whether we can identify previous opportunities to amend the pleading. Loyola Academy v. S & S Roof Maintenance, Inc. , 146 Ill. 2d 263, 273, 166 Ill.Dec. 882, 586 N.E.2d 1211 (1992).\n¶ 27 Here, Ellen would certainly have been prejudiced had John been permitted to add six new causes of action to his petition at the end of June 2016, as it would have delayed the dissolution proceedings, scheduled for trial in early July, for an indeterminate amount of time. And John failed to take advantage of opportunities to amend his pleading given that he became aware of the GRAT and its contents, on which his fraud claims were based, during discovery in the dissolution proceedings, which had been ongoing for over two years. In addition, John knew of the existence of the QPRT when he executed it in 2012, although he alleges that he did not read the provision retaining Ellen as the beneficiary of the trust in the event of divorce. At the latest, when John initially filed his counterpetition in February 2016, he was aware of all his claims arising out of the GRAT and QPRT. This is evidenced by the fact that he filed a complaint raising those claims in the law division less than one week after filing his counterpetition. The court's order denying John's motion to amend his counterpetition, which took into consideration these factors, was thus well within its discretion. See Hartzog v. Martinez , 372 Ill. App. 3d 515, 526, 310 Ill.Dec. 168, 865 N.E.2d 492 (2007) (holding trial court's denial of plaintiffs' motion to amend pleading was within court's discretion where plaintiffs had sufficient previous opportunity to amend).\n¶ 28 John next argues that the trial court's dissolution judgment was \"incomplete\" and \"unsalvageable,\" and conflicted \"with the mandates of the [Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act].\" Specifically, John argues that the court erred in failing to classify the corpus of the QPRT and GRAT as marital or nonmarital property and apportion it accordingly in the judgment of dissolution. We agree with Ellen that John acquiesced in the omission of the classification and valuation of the QPRT and GRAT in the dissolution judgment and is estopped from arguing the contrary position on appeal.\n¶ 29 It is well-settled that a party cannot request to proceed in one manner at trial and then argue on appeal that the requested action was error. Gaffney v. Board of Trustees of the Orland Fire Protection District , 2012 IL 110012, ¶ 33, 360 Ill.Dec. 549, 969 N.E.2d 359 ; see also In re Stephen K. , 373 Ill. App. 3d 7, 25, 310 Ill.Dec. 768, 867 N.E.2d 81 (2007) (\"A party is estopped from taking a position on appeal that is inconsistent with a position the party took in the trial court.\"). Stated differently, a party cannot complain of an error that he either induced the court to make or to which he consented. Brax v. Kennedy , 363 Ill. App. 3d 343, 350, 298 Ill.Dec. 994, 841 N.E.2d 137 (2005). The purpose of this rule is that it would be \"manifestly unfair\" to afford relief to a party based on an error the party introduced into the proceedings. Pellico v. Mork , 2018 IL App (2d) 170468, ¶ 20, 101 N.E.3d 168 (citing Gaffney , 2012 IL 110012, ¶ 33, 360 Ill.Dec. 549, 969 N.E.2d 359 ).\n¶ 30 As noted, Ellen moved in limine to bar the allegations contained in John's law division complaint at trial. These allegations concerned the formation of the QPRT (containing the Naples condominium) and the GRAT (containing 30% and 39% of Ellen's interest in Amfotek and Mariah Partners, respectively), which John contended was part of a conspiracy to \"divest and defeat\" his interest in the property. John's response to Ellen's motion asked the court to enter an order \"prohibiting the parties from introducing evidence concerning the issues, facts or underlying subjects raised, all without prejudice, to and in the pending Law Division action.\"\n¶ 31 At the hearing on the motion in limine , Ellen clarified that she was moving to bar \"testimony or evidence\" relating to the causes of action in John's complaint. Counsel for John responded, \"I will join in that.\" The parties then disputed whether the court could value the income Ellen was currently receiving from her interest in the GRAT: John argued that the court should not value this income, as it was nonmarital property, while Ellen contended that because she received the income stream during the marriage, it constituted marital property. The court agreed with Ellen, but held that it would not admit \"evidence pertaining to the underlying value of the GRAT and QPRT,\" to which John's counsel responded \"Wonderful.\" The written order granting the motion closely tracked the language of John's proposed order, stating that the parties were prohibited from \"introducing evidence concerning the issues and facts raised, all without prejudice, to and in the pending Law Division action * * *. This Court shall not adjudicate the claims or issues now pending in [the] Law Division action.\"\n¶ 32 The transcript and written motion make clear that John, just as Ellen, did not want the court to consider the QPRT and the GRAT in its dissolution judgment. Having induced the trial court to omit these trusts from consideration, John has waived any claim that this omission was erroneous. Forest Preserve District v. First National Bank of Franklin Park , 2011 IL 110759, ¶ 27, 356 Ill.Dec. 386, 961 N.E.2d 775 (\"A party may not urge a trial court to follow a course of action, and then, on appeal, be heard to argue that doing so constituted reversible error.\").\n¶ 33 The remainder of John's challenges to the dissolution judgment suffer from the same problem. John argues that it was error to discount the value of Ellen's interest in Amfotek and Mariah Partners based on the fact that she owned less than 100% of those assets, but his own expert applied the 15% lack-of-marketability discount that he challenges on appeal.\n¶ 34 John also contends that the court erred in awarding him $693,315 in two life insurance accounts held by the Ellen J. Reidy Irrevocable Trust and the Ellen J. Reidy Irrevocable Trust II, as those accounts are not the property of either party, but the property of the trusts, and as such, John lacks the ability to realize the cash value of the policies. But this argument, too, is waived based on the fact that John's own proposed judgment order characterized these accounts as marital property and awarded them to him. During oral argument, John explained that he believed the accounts to be marital property based on Ellen's representation in her proposed judgment order. (No evidence regarding the life insurance policies was introduced at trial.) But Ellen did not conceal the fact that these life insurance policies were held in trusts; she indicated as much in her proposed order. We can hardly fault the trial court for entering an order that conformed to the parties' representation that the life insurance policies, though held in trust, were marital property. And a litigant seeking relief on appeal has no chance of success when the claimed error arises from the litigant's conduct in adopting, without question, an adversary's classification of marital property.\n¶ 35 John's final argument with respect to the dissolution judgment is that the court, despite listing Ellen's income stream from the GRAT as an \"other asset[ ],\" failed to value or allocate it to either party in violation of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Act) 750 ILCS 5/101 et seq. (West 2014). Again, the record reflects that John vociferously objected to the valuation of this income, characterizing it as nonmarital property. While the court overruled that objection, neither party introduced evidence of the income Ellen had been receiving from the GRAT, and as such, the court could not ascribe value to it.\n¶ 36 Finally, we address John's claim that the court erred in crediting Ellen for John's attorney fees in excess of her own without holding a hearing on contribution in accordance with section 503(j) of the Act. Id. § 503(j). The parties' dispute centers around whether a final allocation of interim attorney fees is equivalent to an award of contribution that must meet the petition and hearing requirements of section 503(j) of the Act. This presents an issue of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. People ex rel. Madigan v. Kinzer , 232 Ill. 2d 179, 184, 327 Ill.Dec. 546, 902 N.E.2d 667 (2009).\n¶ 37 At the outset, we note that section 508 of the Act, governing attorney fees, makes clear that interim attorney fees and petitions for contribution are distinct, in that interim fees are governed by subsection (c-1) of section 501 of the Act, while an award of contribution must be in accordance with subsection (j) of section 503 of the Act. See 750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2014).\n¶ 38 Section 501(c-1) provides that the court may award interim attorney fees while a case is pending in favor of the petitioning party's counsel for those fees and costs already incurred or to be incurred. Id. § 501(c-1). Subsection (1) of section 501(c-1) sets out the procedures for a hearing on a petition for interim fees, while subsection (2) reads as follows:\n\"Any assessment of an interim award (including one pursuant to an agreed order) shall be without prejudice to any final allocation and without prejudice as to any claim or right of either party or any counsel of record at the time of the award. Any such claim or right may be presented by the appropriate party or counsel at a hearing on contribution under subsection (j) of Section 503 or a hearing on counsel's fees under subsection (c) of Section 508. Unless otherwise ordered by the court at the final hearing between the parties or in a hearing under subsection (j) of Section 503 or subsection (c) of Section 508, interim awards , as well as the aggregate of all other payments by each party to counsel and related payments to third parties, shall be deemed to have been advances from the parties' marital estate .\" (Emphases added.) Id. § 501(c-1)(2).\n¶ 39 John reads subsection (2) to mean that a final allocation of attorney fees is part of a claim for contribution and is governed by section 503(j), which requires a timely petition and a hearing before contribution is awarded. Not so.\n¶ 40 The statutory language makes clear that at some point before final allocation, a party may assert a \"claim or right\" to fees and costs, including a claim for contribution. But that is not what happened here. Rather, Ellen sought a hearing regarding the reasonableness of certain interim fees John was requesting pursuant to the April 13, 2016, order. Instead of holding a hearing, the court accepted evidence via affidavit to \"true-up\" the parties' accounts. This was not in error. See In re Marriage of Altman , 2016 IL App (1st) 143076, ¶ 36, 406 Ill.Dec. 136, 59 N.E.3d 914 (interim fees deemed advances from the marital estate and court can order portion of interim award constituting overpayment to be repaid at end of case) (citing In re Marriage of DeLarco , 313 Ill. App. 3d 107, 113, 245 Ill.Dec. 921, 728 N.E.2d 1278 (2000) ).\nThe court properly credited Ellen for $628,807, constituting the amount of fees and costs John paid in excess of Ellen's.\n¶ 41 Affirmed.\nJustices Pucinski and Walker concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOn appeal, John does not challenge the trial court's denial of his motion to stay the dissolution proceedings while the law division complaint was pending.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE GRIFFIN delivered the opinion of the court.\n¶ 1 Petitioner Sandra Wojcik and respondent Michael Wojcik agreed to dissolve their marriage in a marital settlement agreement. The settlement agreement provided that respondent pay financial support to petitioner for 60 months to support both the petitioner and the parties' then-minor child. After respondent made the payments for 60 months, petitioner requested that the court extend respondent's maintenance obligation.\n¶ 2 Respondent argued that he had satisfied his support obligations under the marital settlement agreement and, thus, that the petition for maintenance should be dismissed. The trial court disagreed. A trial was held and respondent was ordered to pay permanent maintenance to petitioner. The trial court also ordered respondent to pay retroactive maintenance dating back to when the petition was filed and ordered respondent pay prejudgment interest on the retroactive maintenance award. We affirm the trial court's judgment on the issue of maintenance, but we reverse that part of the trial court's judgment that pertains to prejudgment interest.\n¶ 3 BACKGROUND\nÂ¶ 4 Petitioner Sandra Wojcik and respondent Michael Wojcik married in 1978. They had three children during the course of the marriage. In 2005, petitioner filed a petition to dissolve the marriage. The parties entered into a marital settlement agreement, and the trial court entered a judgment dissolving the marriage that incorporated the parties' agreement.\n¶ 5 During the marriage, petitioner was a stay-at-home mom for the most part. When respondent opened his insurance business, petitioner worked there for a few years. Around the time she filed for dissolution of the marriage, petitioner began studies to earn her master's degree. She received her master's degree right around the time the dissolution proceedings were wrapping up.\n¶ 6 Under the dissolution judgment, petitioner received all of the parties' retirement and investment accounts valued at $644,289. Petitioner also received the parties' marital residence in which they had substantial equity and a vehicle. Respondent received the parties' condominium in Chicago and a townhouse they owned, both of which were subject to substantial mortgage obligations. Respondent retained his 25% interest in his parents' home. Respondent also received approximately 7,122 shares of stock in the Horton Group that had substantial value and two vehicles.\nRespondent continued to be employed during the course of the dissolution proceedings. He was making approximately $386,000 in income at the beginning of the proceedings and that amount steadily increased in the ensuing years.\n¶ 7 Among other obligations, respondent agreed to pay petitioner $13,500 per month in unallocated family support for a period of 60 months. The parties agree in their briefs on appeal that \"unallocated family support\" was intended to be a combination of child support for the parties' one minor child and maintenance or alimony for petitioner. The precise language in the settlement agreement, Paragraph 2.0, is that \"Michael shall pay to Sandra, as and for Unallocated Family Support, the periodic sum of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars ($13,500) per month, for a period of sixty (60) months, reviewable.\" Respondent expressly waived any claim to maintenance from petitioner. Petitioner did not expressly waive maintenance from respondent.\n¶ 8 Paragraph 2.1 of the settlement agreement sets forth certain events that might occur that would serve to terminate respondent's obligation to pay unallocated family support. Those termination events are: the death of either petitioner or respondent, petitioner getting remarried, or petitioner cohabitating with another person on a resident, continuing, conjugal basis.\n¶ 9 Paragraph 2.3 of the settlement agreement provides that \"[t]he Unallocated Family Support provided for in Paragraph 2.0 hereof may be modifiable by the Court, provided that an appropriate Notice and Petition seeking modification are filed with the Court in the case between the parties prior to the happening of any of the termination events set forth in Paragraph 2.1 hereof.\" The settlement agreement contains broad waivers and states that each party waives all claims against the other, except for claims based on rights and obligations contained in the agreement.\n¶ 10 There is no present dispute that respondent made the required family support payments for the 60-month period set forth in the parties' agreement. The parties' minor child reached the age of maturity right near the end of that period. A month or so after the unallocated family support payment period ended, petitioner filed a petition to set maintenance. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss that petition, arguing that he had completed the support obligation he undertook by agreement. Respondent's position was that, to the extent the support obligation was modifiable, it could only be modified or extended during the period that the obligation was ongoing, not after he had fulfilled it. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and the case proceeded for trial on the issue of maintenance.\n¶ 11 At trial, both petitioner and respondent testified. A month after the judgment for dissolution of the marriage was entered, petitioner was hired as a teacher. However, she resigned her position as a teacher in 2015, before the trial these post-dissolution proceedings, because of threats she received from students. Petitioner applied for other teaching jobs, but did not secure employment as a teacher. About three months after resigning her teaching position, petitioner was hired in a sales associate position earning $9 per hour plus commissions. She received health benefits.\nShe also worked a few hours a month as a tutor for $13 per hour.\n¶ 12 Petitioner testified that she could find a suitable job based on her education and experience, but that she could not earn enough income to support herself. Exhibits introduced at trial and admitted into evidence show that petitioner's monthly expenses were approximately $6,191 and her monthly income was $1,418. The trial court found petitioner to be credible and found her efforts to secure employment to be reasonable.\n¶ 13 The court imputed the income petitioner was earning as a teacher, finding that such an amount was a reasonable baseline for what she could earn from full-time employment. The trial court found that \"even with Sandra's imputed income she can never achieve the level of income that would allow her to maintain the lifestyle the parties enjoyed during the marriage on her income alone.\" The court gave \"great weight to the 30 year duration of the marriage\" and observed that petitioner's \"ability to earn income was impaired by her domestic duties having foregone or delayed her education and employment,\" while respondent's career was able to thrive. Accordingly, the trial court found that petitioner was entitled to permanent maintenance in an amount ultimately determined to be $5,700 per month. The court also ordered respondent to pay $239,400 in retroactive maintenance plus prejudgment interest on that amount. Respondent appeals.\n¶ 14 ANALYSIS\n¶ 15 I. Motion to Dismiss\nÂ¶ 16 Respondent argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the petition to set maintenance. Respondent maintains that he fulfilled his maintenance obligation under the dissolution judgment and, therefore, that the trial court lacked the authority to set a new support obligation. Respondent's motion to dismiss was brought under section 2-619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure ( 735 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (West 2016) ).\n¶ 17 A section 2-619 motion to dismiss admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint. 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (West 2016). The purpose of a section 2-619 motion to dismiss is to dispose of issues of law and easily proved issues of fact at the outset of the litigation. In re Estate of Gallagher , 383 Ill. App. 3d 901, 903, 322 Ill.Dec. 330, 890 N.E.2d 1249 (2008). Although a section 2-619 motion to dismiss admits the legal sufficiency of a complaint, it raises defects, defenses, or some other affirmative matter appearing on the face of the complaint or established by external submissions, that defeat the plaintiff's claim. Ball v. County of Cook , 385 Ill. App. 3d 103, 107, 324 Ill.Dec. 548, 896 N.E.2d 334 (2008). We review the trial court's decision on a motion to dismiss de novo . American Family Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tyler , 2016 IL App (1st) 153502, ¶ 9, 409 Ill.Dec. 589, 68 N.E.3d 442.\n¶ 18 The marital settlement agreement provides that \"Michael shall pay to Sandra, as and for Unallocated Family Support, the periodic sum of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars ($13,500) per month, for a period of sixty (60) months, reviewable.\" The parties both acknowledge that unallocated family support is comprised of child support and support for petitioner. The parties' minor child reached the age of maturity during the set payment period, so child support is not an issue. So we must address respondent's contention that the trial court did not have authority to order maintenance to continue after the 60-month period set forth in the marital settlement agreement had already elapsed.\n¶ 19 Respondent maintains that \"[a] review or extension of maintenance may only occur where a judgment awards or reserves maintenance in the first place\" (citing In re Marriage of Heasley , 2014 IL App 2d 130937, ¶ 25), 389 Ill.Dec. 111, 25 N.E.3d 1137. But the marital settlement agreement in this case expressly states that respondent's support obligation is \"reviewable.\" The parties did agree that the support obligation was reserved and could be reviewed. The parties also agreed that the court could modify the support obligation provided that a petition was filed and no termination event had occurred. \"[T]he intent of the parties to preclude or limit modification or termination of maintenance must be clearly manifested in their agreement.\" (Emphasis in original). In re Marriage of Brent , 263 Ill. App. 3d 916, 923, 200 Ill.Dec. 799, 635 N.E.2d 1382 (1994). There is no such manifestation of intent to limit the modification of maintenance in the marital settlement agreement in this case. Instead, it was expressly made reviewable.\n¶ 20 Nonetheless, respondent argues that petitioner was required to bring her petition to review and modify the maintenance obligation before the original, reviewable payment period expired. So respondent acknowledges that his support obligation was reviewable, but suggests that petitioner had to seek extended support a few weeks earlier than she did. The same argument made by respondent was squarely rejected in In re Marriage of Rodriguez , 359 Ill. App. 3d 307, 312-13, 295 Ill.Dec. 846, 834 N.E.2d 71 (2005).\n¶ 21 In Rodriguez , the former husband argued that because the former wife did not petition for review of maintenance within the four-year period set for maintenance in the court's original order, the former wife was forever barred from seeking an extension of maintenance. Id. at 312, 295 Ill.Dec. 846, 834 N.E.2d 71. We rejected that argument and held that the trial court was entitled to review the maintenance award even though the original maintenance payment period had lapsed. Id. at 313, 295 Ill.Dec. 846, 834 N.E.2d 71. In this case, petitioner filed the petition to review maintenance just weeks after the original, admittedly-reviewable support obligation ended.\n¶ 22 The marital settlement agreement does not state that respondent's support obligations will terminate in 60 months. It states that the obligation will endure 60 months, reviewable. That is why respondent's reliance on Rice v. Rice , 173 Ill. App. 3d 1098, 1101, 123 Ill.Dec. 630, 528 N.E.2d 14 (1988) is misplaced.\n¶ 23 In Rice , the trial court ordered that time-limited maintenance payments be made and included no provision for review. In this case, we have a clear provision for review. Nothing in the marital settlement agreement states that respondent's support obligations would end after five years. There was no automatic termination clause included. The inclusion of \"reviewable\" after stating the duration of the original payment term is significant. In construing a contract, effect must be given to each clause and word used, without rejecting any words as meaningless or surplusage. Hufford v. Balk, 113 Ill. 2d 168, 172, 100 Ill.Dec. 564, 497 N.E.2d 742 (1986).\n¶ 24 Also, as in Rodriguez , the settlement agreement in this case contained express termination events, none of which ever occurred. The agreement provides that the support obligation may be modified until one of the termination events occurs. \"[T]he Unallocated Family Support provided for in Paragraph 2.0 hereof may be modifiable by the Court , provided that an appropriate Notice and Petition seeking modification are filed with the Court in the case between the parties prior to the happening of any of the termination events set forth in Paragraph 2.1 hereof.\" (Emphasis added). The termination events in paragraph 2.1 are the death of either petitioner or respondent, petitioner getting remarried, or petitioner cohabitating with another person on a resident, continuing, conjugal basis. As none of those events occurred, the trial court was entitled to review the maintenance obligation just as the parties agreed. See In re Marriage of Rodriguez , 359 Ill. App. 3d at 312-13, 295 Ill.Dec. 846, 834 N.E.2d 71 ; see also In re Marriage of Kuyk , 2015 IL App (2d) 140733, ¶¶ 15-19, 396 Ill.Dec. 937, 40 N.E.3d 822.\n¶ 25 Respondent relies on In re Marriage of Doermer , 2011 IL App (1st) 101567, ¶ 17, 353 Ill.Dec. 414, 955 N.E.2d 1225 and maintains that the circumstances in that case are analogous to the circumstances in this case. They are not. In Doermer , our decision that the former wife was not entitled to seek maintenance after the original term expired was based on the fact that the settlement agreement contained an express provision for the termination of maintenance once the former husband paid all of the unallocated family support. Id. at ¶ 4, ¶ 28. The agreement in that case also stated that the former wife would be \"forever barred from receiving maintenance\" once the former husband made all the unallocated maintenance payments. Id. at ¶ 4. In this case, the marital settlement agreement had no such terms. Respondent's support obligation was \"reviewable.\"\n¶ 26 Respondent makes much of the fact that the marital settlement agreement does not use the word \"maintenance\" to describe his original support obligation and instead uses the phrase \"unallocated family support.\" But, as he must, respondent acknowledges that unallocated family support is simply the phrase used to characterize both his child support obligation and his maintenance obligation to petitioner. That phrase was appropriate at the time of contracting because the parties' minor child was 13 and the five-year support period was set to expire when she would be 18. See Blum v. Koster , 235 Ill. 2d 21, 35, 39 n. 2, 335 Ill.Dec. 614, 919 N.E.2d 333 (2009). When unallocated support is used in original agreement to denote both child support and maintenance, the trial court can extend just the maintenance portion of the obligation, reducing the overall support to reflect that child support is no longer included. Id. at 35-36, 335 Ill.Dec. 614, 919 N.E.2d 333.\n¶ 27 The title of Article II in the settlement agreement here states that it concerns \"maintenance.\" Paragraph 2.2 also makes clear that \"[i]t is contemplated and understood by the parties that the Unallocated Family Support Payments provided to be paid by Michael to Sandra pursuant to paragraph 2.0 hereof are intended to be alimony payments * * *.\" Respondent expressly waived his right to receive maintenance from petitioner, while petitioner made no such waiver of maintenance. There is nothing in the marital settlement agreement that prohibits petitioner from seeking or the trial court from considering whether maintenance payments should be extended beyond their initial term.\n¶ 28 The general waivers in the marital settlement agreement similarly fail to bar petitioner from seeking extended support. The waiver provision does not preclude the parties from pursuing rights and remedies preserved under the agreement. As discussed at length above, respondent's support obligation to petitioner was expressly made reviewable, so petitioner did not waive her right to seek extended support.\n¶ 29 II. Award of Extended Support\nÂ¶ 30 Respondent argues that the trial court erred when it ordered him, based on the evidence adduced at trial, to pay permanent maintenance to petitioner. Although not addressed by the parties, we think it is important to restate that, when it comes to maintenance, \"permanent\" does not mean everlasting; it means the obligation is for an indefinite period. Shen v. Shen , 2015 IL App (1st) 130733, ¶ 84, 394 Ill.Dec. 209, 35 N.E.3d 1178. Indefinite maintenance is commonly granted where the parties have grossly disparate earning potentials and where the marriage was lengthy. See In re Marriage of Drury , 317 Ill. App. 3d 201, 210, 251 Ill.Dec. 284, 740 N.E.2d 365 (2000) (holding that the trial court abused its discretion terminating maintenance after 36 months when the parties were married for 29 years and there was a significant disparity in the present and future earning capacities of the parties).\n¶ 31 A trial court's determination awarding maintenance is presumed to be correct. In re Marriage of Donovan , 361 Ill. App. 3d 1059, 1063, 297 Ill.Dec. 823, 838 N.E.2d 310 (2005). A trial court's decision to review or set maintenance will stand unless the trial court abused its discretion. In re Marriage of Heroy , 385 Ill. App. 3d 640, 650-51, 324 Ill.Dec. 310, 895 N.E.2d 1025 (2008). An abuse of discretion occurs only when we can conclude that no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court. Id. at 651, 324 Ill.Dec. 310, 895 N.E.2d 1025.\n¶ 32 Respondent seizes on the trial court's finding that petitioner was \"rehabilitated\" and argues that, because she was rehabilitated, the trial court was forbidden from awarding her continued support. However, even though the court used the term \"rehabilitated\" to describe its finding that petitioner had satisfied her duty to obtain suitable employment, it is clear that the trial court found that she was nonetheless still not self-sufficient.\n¶ 33 The trial court expressed in its written order that it found that petitioner's \"ability to earn income was impaired by her domestic duties having foregone or delayed her education and employment.\" Her domestic duties allowed respondent's career to thrive, the trial court found, noting that he earned an income of around $700,000 in 2015. Petitioner was earning $9 an hour at the same point. During the marriage, petitioner also worked for respondent to help him get the insurance company he was starting off the ground-the company that enabled him to earn the notable income that he earns today. The marital settlement agreement required the court to examine all the factors for an entitlement to maintenance under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act ( 750 ILCS 5/101 et seq. (West 2016) ). See 750 ILCS 5/504 (West 2016) ; 750 ILCS 5/510 (West 2016). Petitioner's efforts at rehabilitation and obtaining suitable employment were just one factor the court was to consider under the agreement.\n¶ 34 In finding that petitioner had \"satisfied her obligation at rehabilitation,\" the trial court was not making a finding that she had achieved self-sufficiency. Instead, it explained that her efforts at rehabilitation since the divorce, namely: earning a master's degree, working full time for seven years as a teacher, and then quickly starting a new job as a sales representative after resigning her teaching position, constituted a good faith effort at self-sufficiency. Even so, the court still found that maintenance was justified because it had become clear that petitioner's earning capacity is such that \"she can never achieve the level of income that would allow her to maintain the lifestyle the parties enjoyed during the marriage on her income alone.\"\nSee In re Marriage of Johnson , 2016 IL App (5th) 140479, ¶ 93, 400 Ill.Dec. 96, 47 N.E.3d 1061 (\"Maintenance is designed to allow the recipient former spouse to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage.\"). But even more than that, the record evidence shows that petitioner cannot earn enough to cover her monthly expenses which are fairly modest in consideration of the marital circumstances. The trial court also rightly considered the length of the marriage, giving \"great weight to the 30 year duration of the marriage.\" The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that maintenance payments were warranted under the circumstances of this case.\n¶ 35 After arguing that petitioner should not be entitled to maintenance because she is rehabilitated, respondent then argues that petitioner should not be entitled to maintenance because she failed to make a good faith effort at rehabilitation. Respondent demeans petitioner's efforts at employment, stating that \"[n]o maintenance recipient has ever become self-supporting by seeking only enjoyable and unchallenging work and working only during the hours and periods of year that pleases him or her.\" Respondent claims that petitioner's efforts at self-support have been \"apathetic.\" Respondent also claims that petitioner is \"disinterested in becoming self-supporting,\" has \"a sense of entitlement,\" and analogizes her basis for seeking maintenance to \"self-imposed poverty.\" The trial court obviously disagreed with these characterizations of petitioner and her work and found that she had made a good faith effort at rehabilitating herself and obtaining suitable employment, considering all the facts. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that petitioner had made reasonable and sufficient efforts at becoming self-supportive.\n¶ 36 Respondent argues that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the amount of maintenance to which petitioner is entitled. In particular, respondent points to the amount of income the trial court imputed to petitioner as too low and he alleges that the trial court failed to consider evidence of petitioner's passive earnings.\n¶ 37 The trial court imputed an income of $46,000 to petitioner. The court found that amount to be the reasonable amount petitioner could earn from full-time employment. That amount was consistent with the evidence that petitioner earned approximately $46,000 a year as her teacher's salary.\n¶ 38 To make his point that petitioner's imputed income should be higher, respondent relies on assumptions and hypotheticals. For example, respondent argues that the imputed income should be increased by raises petitioner might have received if she kept teaching and he argues that petitioner's imputed income should include some amount as a result of her not working during the summer while she was a teacher. Respondent also argues that the trial court ignored the income petitioner would receive from dividends and interest. The trial court rejected respondent's arguments, and we find that the trial court's considerations and calculations to arrive at an amount of imputed income were reasonable and that it did not abuse its discretion. If circumstances change, respondent has the right to seek modification. See supra , ¶ 30. But the trial court's determination was based on current facts , not on the type of conjecture respondent interposes here.\n¶ 39 Respondent contends that petitioner is capable of supporting herself in the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage. To support his position, respondent argues that, during the period between the unallocated family support obligation lapsing and the trial for maintenance, petitioner lived as she did during the marriage. The trial court disagreed, stating that even in consideration of the assets petitioner received in the divorce and \"considering the lifestyle the parties enjoyed during the marriage that even with Sandra's imputed income she can never achieve the level of income that would allow her to maintain the lifestyle the parties enjoyed during the marriage on her income alone.\" The amount awarded was supported by the evidence. There is nothing in the record that would permit us to find that no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.\n¶ 40 III. Prejudgment Interest\n¶ 41 The trial court held that petitioner was entitled to statutory interest on the retroactive maintenance award. The trial court held that petitioner was entitled to prejudgment interest from the time the petition for maintenance was filed until the final judgment on that petition was entered-about a 40-month period. The Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act ( 750 ILCS 5/101 et seq. (West 2016) ) provides that \"[a]ny maintenance obligation including any unallocated maintenance and child support obligation, or any portion of any support obligation, that becomes due and remains unpaid shall accrue simple interest as set forth in Section 505 of this Act.\" 750 ILCS 5/504 (b-5) (West 2016).\n¶ 42 Neither party has pointed us to a case in which this issue has been addressed. Under the circumstances, we hold that prejudgment interest on the retroactive maintenance award is not warranted. The statute states that interest accrues on a support obligation that \"becomes due and remains unpaid.\" Id. In this case, the retroactive maintenance award did not become due and cannot be considered unpaid until the point that the trial court entered the judgment modifying and extending respondent's support obligation.\n¶ 43 Respondent put forth a good faith argument that his support obligations had terminated under the terms of the marital settlement agreement. The trial court decided to extend and modify the support obligation, but respondent could not have known what the trial court would do until it acted, nor could he have known the amount to pay. The award of continued maintenance was to be made in the trial court's discretion. Blum , 235 Ill. 2d at 36, 335 Ill.Dec. 614, 919 N.E.2d 333 (an order to extend or modify maintenance will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion). In fact, respondent was successful in getting the trial court to reduce the maintenance award in a motion to reconsider. So it is not as if respondent was breaching a known, static obligation. Respondent was not unjustifiably withholding money from petitioner. The obligation did not \"become due\" until the trial court entered a final order that it was due. The obligation was not \"unpaid\" until the trial court set the amount and ordered that it be paid. Therefore, the trial court erred in ordering respondent to pay prejudgment interest on the retroactive maintenance award. Nothing in this opinion affects postjudgment interest.\n¶ 44 CONCLUSION\n¶ 45 Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's order modifying and extending respondent's support obligation. We reverse the trial court's order holding that respondent is required to pay prejudgment interest.\n¶ 46 Affirmed in part, reversed in part.\nPresiding Justice Mikva and Justice Walker concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nDuring the marriage, the Horton Group purchased the insurance company that respondent started and owned. Respondent was employed by the Horton Group from that point forward.\nAt the time of dissolution, neither the parties nor the trial court assigned a specific value to the Horton Group stock that respondent was awarded. At the time of the trial in these post-dissolution proceedings, there was evidence that respondent had acquired even more shares and that his interest in the company was worth approximately $1.5 million. For argument's sake, respondent estimates that the shares respondent was awarded might have been worth around $760,000 at the time the marriage was dissolved.",

                            "text": "PRESIDING JUSTICE McBRIDE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 The issue in this probate action is whether the \"Mutual Last Will and Testament\" executed by decedent Alma M. Zivin and her husband in 1983 was a joint and mutual will such that its dispositions, including a considerable bequest to claimant Hebrew University of Jerusalem, became irrevocable upon the husband's death in 1984. Alma executed a will in 2004 that did not include a bequest to the school. After her death and the admission of her 2004 will to probate, Hebrew University of Jerusalem filed a claim against her estate, contending she breached a contract with her husband by not providing for the school. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court found that the prior will lacked any language indicating Alma and her husband, Israel, intended it to be an irrevocable contract and also lacked the usual characteristics of a joint and mutual will. On appeal from an order granting summary judgment to the estate, the school contends that the 1983 will contains five common characteristics of a joint and mutual will and that their presence allowed the trial court to find the will was a binding agreement. The estate responds that this is a misstatement of Illinois law.\n¶ 2 When parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, they agree that only a question of law is involved and invite the court to decide the issues based on the record. Pielet v. Pielet , 2012 IL 112064, ¶ 28, 365 Ill.Dec. 497, 978 N.E.2d 1000. Appellate review of an order granting summary judgment is de novo . Pielet , 2012 IL 112064, ¶ 30, 365 Ill.Dec. 497, 978 N.E.2d 1000. We begin our review with a summary of the relevant facts and the procedural history of the case.\n¶ 3 Alma and Israel's jointly-executed will is titled \"MUTUAL LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF DR. ISRAEL ZIVIN AND ALMA M. ZIVIN.\" It begins with the statement, \"we * * * do hereby make, publish and declare this to be our Mutual Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking any and all Wills and Codicils by us at any time heretofore made.\" In the \"FIRST\" paragraph, the couple directs that all just debts, funeral expenses and administration costs \"be fully paid out of the principal of our estates.\"\n¶ 4 Israel states in the \"SECOND\" paragraph: \"I * * * hereby give, devise and bequeath all of my property whether same may be real, personal or mixed, and wheresoever situated or which I may own or have any interest in at the time of my death, including any lapsed legacies, to my beloved wife, [Alma], for her sole and exclusive use and benefits forever, in the event that I may predecease her.\" The \"THIRD\" paragraph is identical to the \"SECOND\" paragraph, other than switching the names Israel and Alma and the corresponding pronouns. However, if Israel predeceases Alma, she holds back her jewelry and bequeaths it to family members, and it appears she prefers her family members over Israel's. Alma leaves her \"Diamond bracelet and flower shaped diamond pin\" to \"MARTHA YANOFSKY (Sister), of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.\" Alma leaves her \"Diamond ring (Approximately 9-1/2 carats)\" to \"LYNN ZIVIN (Niece), of Chappaqua, New York,\" and we deduce from the last name that Lynn is Israel's niece. Alma leaves her \"Gold watch with diamonds on a background of two gold-plated silver dollars\" to \"NORMA KATZ (Niece) of Denver, Colorado,\" but the record does not disclose whether this niece is one of Israel or Alma's relatives. Alma then says the \"Remainder of my jewelry\" is \"[t]o be divided between my brother, SANDER ALLEN, and my sister, MARTHA YANOFSKY.\"\n¶ 5 The \"FOURTH\" paragraph empowers and directs the co-executors to liquidate \"all of our property, regardless whether real, personal or mixed, as soon after the death of the survivor of us, as they may deem practicable.\" This is followed by:\n\"FIFTH: That in the event that we shall both perish in a common disaster, or following the death of the survivor of us, we give, devise and bequeath the rest, residue and remainder of our estate after payments directed under the above provisions, excluding any property over which we have power of appointment, which [power] we decline to exercise, shall be distributed as follows:\nA. 20% thereof to NEAL JAY YANOFSKY of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts;\nB. 10% thereof to DR. SIMON ZIVIN of Lincolnwood, Illinois;\nC. 10% thereof to SANDER ALLEN of 990 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Illinois;\nD. 10% thereof to THE ARK located at 2341 West Devon Avenue, Chicago, Illinois;\nE. All of our furniture, furnishings and household effects to SANDER ALLEN and MARTHA YANOFSKY in such shares as they may mutually determine between them;\nF. Any remaining property not otherwise effectively disposed of shall be distributed to THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK, as Trustee (hereinafter called 'Trustee'), to be held as a charitable trust for and on behalf of THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM, New York, New York, only, upon the terms and conditions as hereinafter provided.\n1. The Trustee shall hold said Trust Estate as a charitable trust in perpetuity. The Trustee shall pay the entire net income only, and no part of the principal, of the Trust Estate at least annually to said charitable organization, and that the primary purpose of the said trust is for the higher education of students living in Israel.\"\nThe will or other parts of the record on appeal disclose that Neal Jay Yanofsky is the son of Alma's only sister, Martha Yanofsky; Sander Allen is Alma's only brother; and Dr. Simon Zivin predeceased Alma but his surname indicates he was one of Israel's relatives. Thus, like Alma's jewelry, a preference was shown for Alma's relatives over Israel's relatives, in that 30% of the liquidated remainder and 100% of the couple's furniture, furnishings, and household effects is gifted to three of Alma's relatives and only 10% of the liquidated remainder and no other assets are left to Israel's relative, Dr. Simon Zivin. The \"SIXTH\" paragraph details the powers of the trustee to manage, invest, and distribute the trust created to benefit the school.\n¶ 6 In the \"SEVENTH\" paragraph, Alma and Israel appoint each other as their executors, and in the event of a common disaster or after the death of the second spouse, they appoint Dr. Simon Zivin (Israel's relative) and Sander Allen (Alma's relative) as co-executors.\n¶ 7 Israel died in 1984, and later that same year, the 1983 will was filed in the probate division of the circuit court of Cook County.\n¶ 8 Twenty years later, Alma executed her own will, in which she expressly revoked any and all prior wills and codicils, made specific bequests of her personal effects, and gave the rest, residue, and remainder of her estate to a \"pour over trust\" bearing her name. Alma's 2004 will made no provision for Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The Alma M. Zivin Trust, as amended and restated, also made no provision for Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Thirty years after Israel's death, Alma died in Chicago in 2013, at the age of 95 years. Alma and Israel never had children, and when Alma died, she was survived by her brother Sander, of Chicago, and nine adult nieces and nephews in other parts of the United States. The Alma M. Zivin Trust provided for the distribution of specific gifts to family members totaling $415,000, while leaving the residuary of her trust estate to three Chicago charities. Alma's estate included a Chicago condominium unit located at 1212 North Lake Shore Drive No. 9CS, which sold for $662,000 in 2014, and investments, primarily a William Blair account, which brought the value of her estate to $5.8 million for estate tax purposes.\n¶ 9 After Alma's will was filed in the probate division, Hebrew University of Jerusalem filed its claim as the income beneficiary of a charitable trust that Alma and Israel agreed would be established after the death of the second spouse. The school contended it was entitled to 60% of the estate's value. The estate, however, moved for and was granted dismissal on grounds that generally only a trustee has standing to sue third parties on behalf of a trust. In re Estate of Zivin , 2015 IL (1st) 150606, 399 Ill.Dec. 583, 46 N.E.3d 902. The designated trustee was unwilling to bring the school's claim and the school had filed its own claim on what it believed was the last possible day under the statute of limitations. Zivin , 2015 IL (1st) 150606, ¶ 18, 399 Ill.Dec. 583, 46 N.E.3d 902. On appeal, we vacated the dismissal order and remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the designated trustee, a trustee ad litem appointed to pursue the school's claim, or the school itself was the proper plaintiff, or whether the claim should be dismissed. Zivin , 2015 IL (1st) 150606, ¶ 26, 399 Ill.Dec. 583, 46 N.E.3d 902. After the evidentiary hearing, the trial court permitted the school to proceed in its own name, and the parties next filed the cross-motions which led to this second appeal.\n¶ 10 We have jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(b)(1) because the trial court order dated October 18, 2017, granting summary judgment to the estate as to the school's claim, was a final and appealable judgment order and the school filed its notice of appeal within 30 days on November 14, 2017. Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(b)(1) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). The trial court's ruling was based entirely on the language of the will, as no other evidence was offered, such as testimony from the drafting attorney or family members as to Alma and Israel's circumstances when they executed their joint will in 1983.\n¶ 11 Hebrew University of Jerusalem contends that as long as testators include the common characteristics of a joint and mutual will, the most crucial of which is a common dispositive scheme, a court may infer that the testators intended to enter into a joint and mutual will and that the survivor cannot effectively provide for a contrary disposition. The school cites numerous opinions for the proposition that each case must be decided on its own facts; cites Curry , Edwards , and Weaver for the proposition that a common dispositive scheme is the crucial marker of a joint and mutual will; and relies on Schwebel and Helms for the proposition that the presence of the common characteristics alone allows a court to find that an irrevocable contract was intended and binds the surviving spouse to the specified bequests. Curry v. Cotton , 356 Ill. 538, 191 N.E. 307 (1934) ; In re Estate of Edwards , 3 Ill. 2d 116, 120 N.E.2d 10 (1954) ; In re Estate of Weaver , 71 Ill. App. 2d 232, 217 N.E.2d 326 (1966) ; In re Estate of Schwebel , 133 Ill. App. 3d 777, 88 Ill.Dec. 887, 479 N.E.2d 500 (1985) ; Helms v. Darmstatter , 34 Ill. 2d 295, 215 N.E.2d 245 (1966). The school concludes that Alma is estopped from altering the fifth article of her contract with Israel.\n¶ 12 We agree with the school that whether a proffered document can be deemed an enforceable joint and mutual will is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Rauch v. Rauch , 112 Ill. App. 3d 198, 200-01, 67 Ill.Dec. 785, 445 N.E.2d 77 (1983). However, as discussed below, we find that the remainder of the school's argument is incorrect and unpersuasive and that Alma was empowered to revoke her 1983 will and free to dispose of her assets as she saw fit.\n¶ 13 The terms \"mutual will\" and \"joint will\" are sometimes used incorrectly by testators. Curry , 356 Ill. at 543, 191 N.E. 307. Nevertheless, the meaning of these legal terms is well established. A joint will is a single instrument that contains the wills of two or more persons and disposes of property that they own jointly, in common, or in severalty. Platz v. Walk , 3 Ill. 2d 313, 316, 121 N.E.2d 483 (1954) ; Frazier v. Patterson , 243 Ill. 80, 84-85, 90 N.E. 216 (1909). A joint will may be probated on the death of each maker as his or her will. Curry , 356 Ill. at 543, 191 N.E. 307 ; Frazier , 243 Ill. at 84, 90 N.E. 216. A joint will may or may not also be a mutual or reciprocal will. Frazier , 243 Ill. at 84, 90 N.E. 216 ; Platz , 3 Ill. 2d at 316, 121 N.E.2d 483. A joint will that is not reciprocal is simply the individual personal will of each of the persons executing the document and is subject to the same rules that would apply if the wills were several. Frazier , 243 Ill. at 84, 90 N.E. 216.\n¶ 14 Mutual or reciprocal wills are the separate wills of two or more testators that contain reciprocal terms such that each testator makes disposition of his or her respective property in favor of the other. Frazier , 243 Ill. at 84, 90 N.E. 216 ; Curry , 356 Ill. at 543, 191 N.E. 307 ; Platz , 3 Ill. 2d at 316, 121 N.E.2d 483.\n¶ 15 A will that is both joint and mutual is a jointly-executed document with reciprocal terms and shows on its face that the bequests are made in consideration of the other. Platz , 3 Ill. 2d at 316-17, 121 N.E.2d 483 ; Curry , 356 Ill. at 543, 191 N.E. 307 ; Frazier , 243 Ill. at 84, 90 N.E. 216. A joint and mutual will becomes irrevocable upon the death of the first spouse \"on the theory that the first that dies carries his part of the contract into execution. In such case the courts will not permit the other party to afterwards break the contract.\" Frazier , 243 Ill. at 85, 90 N.E. 216. It is the contract between the testators that renders a joint will irrevocable and estops the survivor from disposing of the property other than as provided in the will. See, e.g. , Frazier , 243 Ill. at 84-85, 90 N.E. 216 ; Curry , 356 Ill. at 546, 191 N.E. 307 ; In re Estate of Erickson , 363 Ill. App. 3d 279, 282, 299 Ill.Dec. 372, 841 N.E.2d 1104 (2006) ; Rauch , 112 Ill. App. 3d at 200, 67 Ill.Dec. 785, 445 N.E.2d 77.\n¶ 16 The contract to mutually dispose of the property may be verbal, may be contained in a separate document, or may be embodied in the will itself. See In re Mueller's Estate , 26 Ill. App. 3d 163, 165, 324 N.E.2d 674 (1975) (existence or non-existence of an irrevocable contract is to be gathered from the terms of the will and evidence of the surrounding circumstances). Regardless of where it is located, the agreement must be certain and definite, founded upon adequate consideration, and established by clear and convincing evidence. Jordan v. McGrew , 400 Ill. 275, 280, 79 N.E.2d 622 (1948). In Basich , for example, the drafting attorney testified that the testators told her that if one of them survived, the other would not change their joint will. In re Estate of Basich , 79 Ill. App. 3d 997, 1003, 35 Ill.Dec. 232, 398 N.E.2d 1182 (1979). In the instant case, however, there was no testimony about the drafting or execution of the 1983 will; no testimony about Alma and Israel's families and close friends; and no testimony suggesting that Alma and Israel had such a close connection to Hebrew University of Jerusalem that the couple would not make a bequest to the school but also agree to make it an irrevocable bequest. Accordingly, we will be considering the 1983 will in light of cases such as Orso and Flemming , discussed below, which analyzed the testators'\nwritten wills. Orso v. Lindsey , 233 Ill. App. 3d 881, 174 Ill.Dec. 403, 598 N.E.2d 1035 (1992) ; Moline National Bank v. Flemming , 91 Ill. App. 3d 398, 46 Ill.Dec. 883, 414 N.E.2d 936 (1980).\n¶ 17 In a previous era, a married couple's joint will with reciprocal provisions would create a presumption that the will was mutual-that is, executed pursuant to a contract not to revoke the dispositions. See Frazier , 243 Ill. at 86-87, 90 N.E. 216 (filed in 1909). In 1954, however, about 29 years before Alma and Israel executed their 1983 will, the Illinois Supreme Court surveyed Illinois precedent and came to the conclusion that the trend was for courts to search the language of a will for indications that it was executed pursuant to a binding contract to be irrevocable. Estate of Edwards , 3 Ill. 2d at 122, 120 N.E.2d 10. See also In re Estate of Signore , 149 Ill. App. 3d 904, 103 Ill.Dec. 261, 501 N.E.2d 282 (1986) (although it has been stated that a joint will between husband and wife raises a presumption that the will was executed pursuant to a contract not to revoke, later decisions have been reluctant to allow the presumption to be sufficient in itself). We are to read the document as a whole and consider the relevant circumstances of the testators and beneficiaries to determine the testators' intent and the extent of their agreement, if any, that the will was executed pursuant to a contract not to revoke. See e.g. , Schwebel , 133 Ill. App. 3d at 783-84, 88 Ill.Dec. 887, 479 N.E.2d 500 (determination that the joint will of two brothers was irrevocable was based on presence of common characteristics of a joint and mutual will and the fact that the testators were \"notoriously close in terms of trust and affection\" and chose to dispose of their estates by a joint document). See also Joint or Mutual Wills , 61 Harv. L. Rev. 675, 679 (1948) (\"The provisions and expressions contained in the wills, and the relationship of the testators between themselves and with the ultimate beneficiaries, have often been considered factors of evidential value [in determining whether an irrevocable bargain was reached].\").\n¶ 18 The party asserting a joint and mutual will has the burden of establishing the contract by clear and convincing evidence. Jacoby v. Jacoby , 342 Ill. App. 277, 283, 96 N.E.2d 362, 365 (1950) (burden of proof is on the party asserting the existence of the contract, and he must establish that the will is contractual as well as testamentary in character; this burden is not sustained by proof which permits an inference either way); Tontz v. Heath , 20 Ill. 2d 286, 291, 170 N.E.2d 153, 156 (1960) (burden is on the party asserting such a contract to establish it by clear and convincing evidence). \"Clear and convincing evidence is that quantum of proof which leaves no reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact of the truth of the fact in issue.\" In re Estate of Weaver , 75 Ill. App. 2d 227, 229, 220 N.E.2d 321, 322 (1966). Clear and convincing is a higher standard of proof than mere predominance of the evidence and has also been described as evidence \"which leaves the mind well satisfied of the truth of a proposition,\" \"strikes all minds alike as being unquestionable,\" or \"leads to but one conclusion.\" In re Estate of Ragen , 79 Ill. App. 3d 8, 13-14, 34 Ill.Dec. 523, 398 N.E.2d 198 (1979).\n¶ 19 Hebrew University of Jerusalem relied entirely on the will and offered no other evidence. The trial court considered the terms contained in the four corners of the 1983 will to determine whether Alma and Israel contracted to execute a joint and mutual will and found that it lacked any indication of a binding agreement. Our de novo review also leads us to find that the 1983 will does not constitute a contract between the parties that estopped Alma from disposing of the property in some other way.\n¶ 20 The will at issue in Orso was drafted in 1960. Orso , 233 Ill. App. 3d 881, 174 Ill.Dec. 403, 598 N.E.2d 1035. Marion and Charles expressly stated they were executing their \" 'joint and mutual last will and testament.' \" Orso , 233 Ill. App. 3d at 883, 174 Ill.Dec. 403, 598 N.E.2d 1035. After setting out their common plan to dispose of their assets, Marion and Charles concluded, \" 'This joint and mutual will is made in pursuance of a contract or agreement between us for the disposition of all of our property, whether owned by us as joint tenants or as tenants in common, in the manner hereinabove, in this, our last will and testament * * *.' \" Orso , 233 Ill. App. 3d at 885, 174 Ill.Dec. 403, 598 N.E.2d 1035. Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which bore the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence, has not pointed to any comparable language in the Orsos 1960 will and the Zivins 1983 will.\n¶ 21 We contrast Alma and Israel's language with the Flemming joint and mutual will, which was written in 1966. Flemming , 91 Ill. App. 3d at 400, 46 Ill.Dec. 883, 414 N.E.2d 936. The testators stated in relevant part:\n\" 'We, Albert Flemming and Eva K. Flemming, * * * do each mutually in consideration of the other making this Will, and the provisions made herein by each of us in favor of the other, make, publish and declare this to be our Last Will and Testament, intending to provide herein for the ultimate disposition of all of our property, be it in joint tenancy, tenancy in common or in our individual names, and we agree that the same cannot be changed or varied without the consent in writing of the other * * *.' \" Flemming , 91 Ill. App. 3d at 400, 46 Ill.Dec. 883, 414 N.E.2d 936.\nThe Flemmings expressly referred to the consideration necessary to make an agreement a binding agreement, acknowledged that the provisions were reciprocal, specified they were agreeing to the \"ultimate disposition\" of all their property, and also stated that the terms could not be changed without the written consent of the other spouse. The Flemmings buttressed their clear and binding language by also signing and attaching to their joint and mutual will an independent contract, in which they stated:\n\"CONTRACT TO EXECUTE JOINT LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\nThis contract, made and executed, in duplicate, this 7th day of February, 1966, between ALBERT FLEMMING, party of the first part, and EVA K. FLEMMING, party of the second part.\nWITNESSETH\nWhereas, the parties hereto do desire to duly execute a joint Last Will and Testament, which disposes of their respective estates in accordance with their individual desires and mutual agreement and which said joint will is dated and being executed concurrently with this contract; and\nWhereas, they desire to make certain that said joint Last Will and Testament cannot be changed, varied, altered or revoked by either of them without the consent in writing of the other, or as provided in the following paragraph.\nNow, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the execution by each of the parties hereto of said joint Last Will and Testament dated and executed concurrently with this contract, the parties hereto do agree for themselves, their respective heirs, devisees and assigns that said joint Last Will and Testament will not be changed, varied, altered or revoked by either of them without the consent in writing of the other. In the event our marriage to each other should terminate by divorce or annulment, this contract shall then be automatically cancelled and be of no further force or effect whatsoever.' \" Flemming , 91 Ill. App. 3d at 401, 46 Ill.Dec. 883, 414 N.E.2d 936.\n¶ 22 The Flemmings' words clearly and convincingly state that they are irrevocably bound to the bequests they make in their will, unless they mutually agree to a modification or revocation or their marriage ends. The Flemmings drafted and executed these terms in 1966, almost 17 years before the Zivins drafted and executed their will in 1983, and the Flemming opinion was published in December 1980, more than two years before the Zivins wrote and signed their will in January 1983. Hebrew University of Jerusalem, however, which bore the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence, has not pointed to any comparable language in the Flemming and Zivin wills.\n¶ 23 The testator in Aimone , Edith, was a contemporary of the Zivins who executed her will in May 1984, shortly after the Zivins executed their will in January 1983. In re Estate of Aimone , 226 Ill. App. 3d 1057, 1058-59, 168 Ill.Dec. 772, 590 N.E.2d 94 (1992). Edith stated:\n\" 'I have made this Last Will and Testament pursuant to a contract and agreement between my husband and me for the purpose of disposing of all our property, whether owned by us as joint tenants, as tenants in common or in severalty, in accordance with a common plan. The reciprocal and other gifts made herein are in fulfillment of this purpose and plan and in consideration of each waiving the right, during our joint lives, to alter, amend or revoke our respective and mutual Last Wills and Testaments, in whole or in part, by Codicil or otherwise, without notice to the other, or under any circumstances after the death of the first of us to die.' \" Aimone , 226 Ill. App. 3d at 1058-59, 168 Ill.Dec. 772, 590 N.E.2d 94.\nEdith not only referred to a \" 'contract and agreement,' \" she also indicated there was a \" 'common plan' \" and specified that the bequests were made in furtherance of that \" 'purpose and plan' \" and could not be unilaterally changed without notice to her husband during their lifetimes and not at all after his death. Aimone , 226 Ill. App. 3d at 1058-59, 168 Ill.Dec. 772, 590 N.E.2d 94. Alma and Israel's 1983 will, however, does not include any language limiting either spouse's right to unilaterally revoke or otherwise change the bequests.\n¶ 24 Illinois precedent does not require that testators make an express reference to a contract or execute a separate contract to support their will. However, the later-cited authority illustrates the clear and certain language that some testators have used to express their intention to enter into irrevocable dispositions.\n¶ 25 Hebrew University of Jerusalem relies heavy on Helms , in which George and Lena executed a will that did not expressly refer to a contract between them, but the court found it otherwise clearly indicated that they entered into a binding agreement providing for the disposition of their estates upon the death of each of them and upon the death of the survivor of them. Helms , 34 Ill. 2d at 298-99, 215 N.E.2d 245. We do not find Helms particularly relevant, given that George and Lena's will was drafted in 1947, about 40 years prior to Alma and Israel's will in 1983, when it could still be presumed from the fact that testators were married that they intended for their will to be not only joint but mutual. See Frazier , 243 Ill. at 86-87, 90 N.E. 216 ; Estate of Edwards , 3 Ill. 2d at 122, 120 N.E.2d 10 ;\nSchwebel , 133 Ill. App. 3d at 783, 88 Ill.Dec. 887, 479 N.E.2d 500. In any event, George and Lena stated in part as follows:\n\" 'We, GEORGE LORTZ and LENA LORTZ, of the County of St. Clair and State of Illinois, being of sound mind and memory, do hereby make, publish and declare this is be [ (sic) ] our Joint Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking and making void all former wills by us or either of us at any time heretofore made.\n* * *\nFIFTH: We respectively hereby give, devise and bequeath, all the rest, residue and remainder of our property, both real and personal of whatsoever kind or nature, which we or either of us now own or may hereafter acquire and wherever located and which shall remain after the payment of all claims and bequests against our respective estates, to the survivor of us, as his or her absolute property forever.\nSIXTH: After the death of the survivor of either of us or in case of the death of both of us at the same time, we respectively order and direct that the residue of our estates be merged into one Corpus, by reducing all of our property, both real and personal, into cash and for that purpose we respectively authorize our Executors to convert the same, by selling all our Real Estate and tangible property, within Two (2) years after our deaths, or the death of the survivor of us, and execute proper deeds to the purchasers thereof, and pay the expenses of evidences of title and the preparation of deeds and if necessary, in their judgment, employ a surveyor and legal counsel to protect the interest held by us at our deaths, and after all of our property, both real and personal, has been reduced and converted into cash and all the debts, claims, and charges against our estates, including taxes and costs of Administration have been paid in full, we hereby order and direct our Executors to pay out of the remainder of said Corpus, the sums of money hereinafter set forth, and we hereby give and bequeath, as follows:\n* * *\nSEVENTH: In case there still remains a surplus or residue in the Corpus of our estates after the legacies and bequests hereinbefore provided for and all other charges and expenses connected with the settlement of our estates have been paid out and satisfied, we hereby order and direct that such surplus or residue be divided among all of the legatees mentioned in this Will in the same proportion and at the same ratio, that the specific bequests hereinbefore made, bear to the remainder or residue of said Corpus.' \" Helms , 34 Ill. 2d at 298-99, 215 N.E.2d 245.\n¶ 26 Looking at all the circumstances, the trial court found that the George and Lena had intended a joint and mutual will. Helms , 34 Ill. 2d at 301, 215 N.E.2d 245. Although each case must be viewed individually, there are generally five common features of a joint and mutual will: the testators of a joint and mutual will (1) label their will as such, (2) include reciprocal provisions which dispose of the entire estate in favor of the other testator, (3) pool their interests or merge their estates into a common corpus, (4) have a common dispositive scheme under which they dispose of the common fund by bequeathing it approximately equally to each side of the family, and (5) use plural pronouns and terms such as \"we give\" and \"our estate.\" Rauch , 112 Ill. App. 3d at 200-01, 67 Ill.Dec. 785, 445 N.E.2d 77 (presence of all five characteristics clearly indicated that a husband and wife intended for their jointly-executed will to be a joint and mutual will). Other courts expand on this list of five factors to also consider whether the testators expressly agreed that no revocation could be made without the consent of the other testator and whether the testators limited the survivor's use of the property. Signore , 149 Ill. App. 3d at 906, 103 Ill.Dec. 261, 501 N.E.2d 282 (concluding that a joint will was not a joint and mutual will rendered irrevocable by the death of the first spouse, due to clause stating that a document was the couples' \" 'Last Will and Testament, with full reservation by both or either of us to change the terms hereof at any time' \"); Larison v. Record , 117 Ill. 2d 444, 450, 111 Ill.Dec. 614, 512 N.E.2d 1251 (1987) (testator's intent is to be determined from the evidence, no language in unambiguous will limited survivor's right to make a new will, and court would not guess or speculate whether the testator intended a different disposition); Mueller , 26 Ill. App. 3d 163, 324 N.E.2d 674 (the joint will or other evidence must indicate the testators agreed the disposition could not be revoked without the other's consent, include the mutuality of promises or reciprocal consideration, merge both estates into one corpus, and limit the use of the property by the surviving spouse).\nÂ¶ 27 Hebrew University of Jerusalem incorrectly argues that a common dispositive scheme is the crucial feature of a joint and mutual will. The school relies on Curry , 356 Ill. 538, 191 N.E. 307, Edwards , 3 Ill. 2d 116, 120 N.E.2d 10, and Weaver , 71 Ill. App. 2d 232, 217 N.E.2d 326, which do not support this conclusion; moreover, the school is incorrectly stating the characteristic. Courts, including Helms , have looked for a common dispositive scheme under which the testators dispose of the common fund by bequeathing it approximately equally to each side of the family . Rauch , 112 Ill. App. 3d at 200-01, 67 Ill.Dec. 785, 445 N.E.2d 77 ; Signore , 149 Ill. App. 3d at 906, 103 Ill.Dec. 261, 501 N.E.2d 282.\n¶ 28 Hebrew University of Jerusalem misconstrues Helms , when it argues that Alma and Israel's joint will is similar to George and Lena's will and expresses a contract or agreement between them that the bequests they intended in 1983 became irrevocable upon Israel's death in 1984. George and Lena both executed their joint will, and purported to dispose of property that they owned jointly, in common, or severally. Each made a disposition of his or her entire estate in favor of the other, stating \"We respectively hereby give, devise and bequeath, all the rest, residue and remainder of our property* * * to the survivor of us, as his or her absolute property forever.\" However, in the next clause George and Lena merged both estates into a common corpus and then jointly directed that the corpus be divided equally between their families so that George's 18 relatives received approximately the same amount of Lena's 19 relatives. Thus, George and Lena's will \"shows on its face that the bequests [were] made one in consideration of the other.\" Curry , 356 Ill. at 543, 191 N.E. 307. Alma and Israel, however, had a different arrangement.\n¶ 29 Their will was titled \"MUTUAL LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF DR. ISRAEL ZIVIN AND ALMA M. ZIVIN\" and is not labeled as the joint and mutual will of the testators.\n¶ 30 The SECOND and THIRD paragraphs are not reciprocal provisions, in that Israel makes a disposition of all of his property to Alma, but Alma conditions the disposition of her estate on Israel's survival and otherwise holds back valuable assets primarily for the benefit of her family members. In the event Israel predeceases her, Alma reserves all of her jewelry, makes bequests of three specific pieces, and gives 100% of her remaining jewelry to her brother and sister.\n¶ 31 In the FOURTH and FIFTH paragraphs, Alma and Israel pool their estates, but they do not make reciprocal or identical dispositions to their respective sides of the family. What is left after the disposition of the Alma's jewelry is merged together, and this pooled estate is divided unequally between the two sides of the family. Fully 30% of the remainder is carved out for Alma's relatives and 100% of the furniture, furnishings, and household effects is left to Alma's brother and sister. Only 10% of the corpus is left to Israel's relative. Another 10% is earmarked for The Ark and any remaining property not already effectively disposed of is left to Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Thus, although there is pooling, there is no common dispositive scheme under which Alma and Israel dispose of a common fund by bequeathing it to their heirs in approximately equal shares. Alma's bequest to Israel is conditional and, regardless of which spouse dies first, Alma's side of the family is to receive a much larger percentage of the estate than Israel's side of the family The will does not \"show[ ] on its face that the bequests [were] made one in consideration of the other.\" Curry , 356 Ill. at 543, 191 N.E. 307. If the unequal bequests are attributable to other facts, such as an attempt to balance prior gifts that favored Israel's heirs, Hebrew University of Jerusalem failed to make those facts part of the record.\n¶ 32 We also look for the use of common plural terms such as \"we\" and \"our\" as further indications of the testators' intent to make a joint and mutual will. Alma and Israel did frequently use \"we\" and \"our,\" and they appointed each other as the executor. In the event of a common disaster or after the death of the second spouse, they jointly appointed one of his family members and one of her family members (Dr. Simon Zivin and Sander Allen) to act as joint executors. The frequent use of \"we\" and \"our\" is not sufficient reason for us to infer that Alma and Israel intended their will to be irrevocable.\n¶ 33 There is no language, one way or another, specifying that the surviving spouse maintained the right to revoke the will or otherwise modify its bequests.\n¶ 34 There is no express indication that the surviving spouse was given only a life estate or impliedly restricted from disposing of any assets. To the contrary, in the SECOND and THIRD paragraphs, each of the spouses gives all of their property, absolutely, to the other, in perpetuity. Each resolved to \"give, devise and bequeath all of my property whether same may be real, personal or mixed, and wheresoever situated or which I may own or have any interest in at the time of my death, including any lapsed legacies, to my beloved * * * for [his or her] sole and exclusive use and benefits forever, in the event that I may predecease [him or her].\"\n¶ 35 We find no significance in the fact that the testators' signature lines conclude with the word \"(SEAL).\" The school's reliance on this single word is misplaced because this is not an instance like Curry in which the surviving testator expressly \"covenanted\" to make certain bequests and the court concluded this stipulation meant \"the instrument is under seal.\" Curry , 356 Ill. at 547, 191 N.E. 307.\n¶ 36 Reading Alma and Israel's 1983 will as a whole, we conclude it lacks contracting terminology and does not include the typical defining characteristics of an irrevocable agreement to provide for the ultimate disposition of their estates. All in all, we cannot say that the terms of the 1983 will preclude the surviving testator from revoking the document and creating a new plan.\n¶ 37 Hebrew University of Jerusalem also misconstrues Edwards , 3 Ill. 2d at 116, 120 N.E.2d 10. During oral arguments, the school contended that the Edwards will mirrored Alma and Israel's 1983 will. We disagree. The Edwards will expressed the couple's agreement that the surviving spouse would have the use and enjoyment of certain assets only \"during his or her lifetime,\" that the survivor could not \"sell any of the real estate owned by the other during his or her life,\" and that a woman who had lived with and cared for the couple for more than 10 years, was to have everything upon the death of the surviving spouse. Edwards , 3 Ill. 2d at 117-18, 120 N.E.2d 10. There are no such restrictions in Alma and Israel's 1983 will.\n¶ 38 We conclude that Hebrew University of Jerusalem has failed to establish a fact necessary for its claim-that Alma was bound by a contract with Israel that required her to maintain the dispositions stated in the joint will. Alma and Israel's 1983 will does not communicate their intent to enter into a joint and mutual will such that Alma could not subsequently revoke the 1983 will and execute her own plan in 2004, which did not provide for Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment against Hebrew University of Jerusalem and in favor of the estate as to the school's claim that it was entitled to enforce the terms of the 1983 will.\n¶ 39 Affirmed.\nJustices Ellis and Burke concurred in the judgment and opinion.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE THEIS delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 In these consolidated appeals we consider the temporal reach of two legislative enactments: (1) an amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (Act) ( 705 ILCS 405/5-130 (West 2016) ), which, inter alia , eliminated armed robbery while armed with a firearm and aggravated vehicular hijacking while armed with a firearm from the list of automatic transfer offenses, and (2) the new juvenile sentencing provisions codified in section 5-4.5-105 of the Unified Code of Corrections (Code) (730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105 (West 2016)), which, inter alia , give the trial court discretion not to impose otherwise mandatory firearm sentencing enhancements. The appellate court rejected defendants' arguments for retroactive application of these statutes to their cases that were pending on direct review when the statutes became effective and affirmed defendants' convictions and sentences. People v. Hunter , 2016 IL App (1st) 141904, ¶¶ 62, 73, 407 Ill.Dec. 1, 62 N.E.3d 246 ; People v. Wilson , 2016 IL App (1st) 141500, ¶ 16, 407 Ill.Dec. 84, 62 N.E.3d 329. We affirm the judgments of the appellate court, albeit for different reasons.\n¶ 2 BACKGROUND\n¶ 3 No. 121306-People v. Hunter\n¶ 4 In June 2011, the State charged defendant Kevin Hunter with aggravated vehicular hijacking ( 720 ILCS 5/18-4(a)(4) (West 2010)), aggravated kidnapping ( 720 ILCS 5/10-2(a)(6) (West 2010)), and armed robbery ( 720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2) (West 2010)), all while armed with a firearm. The charges arose out of an incident the previous month in which Hunter and two unidentified men robbed Steven Maxwell of personal property including his vehicle and kidnapped him, all at gunpoint. At the time of the offenses, Hunter was 16 years old.\n¶ 5 The version of section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act then in effect provided as follows:\n\" § 5-130. Excluded jurisdiction.\n(1)(a) The definition of delinquent minor under Section 5-120 of this Article shall not apply to any minor who at the time of an offense was at least 15 years of age and who is charged with: (i) first degree murder, (ii) aggravated criminal sexual assault, (iii) aggravated battery with a firearm where the minor personally discharged a firearm * * *, (iv) armed robbery when the armed robbery was committed with a firearm, or (v) aggravated vehicular hijacking when the hijacking was committed with a firearm.\nThese charges and all other charges arising out of the same incident shall be prosecuted under the criminal laws of this State.\" 705 ILCS 405/5-130 (West 2010).\nPursuant to this statute, Hunter was tried in adult court.\n¶ 6 Following a bench trial in the circuit court of Cook County, Hunter was convicted on all three counts. The trial court sentenced Hunter to 21 years on each count-the 6-year minimum for a Class X felony, plus the mandatory 15-year firearm enhancement-to be served concurrently. See 720 ILCS 5/18-4(b) (West 2010); 720 ILCS 5/10-2(b) (West 2010); 720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (West 2010); 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-25(a) (West 2010). Hunter appealed.\n¶ 7 While Hunter's case was pending in the appellate court, Public Acts 99-69 and 99-258 became effective. Both Public Acts adopted new, identical sentencing provisions applicable to defendants under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the offense. Pub. Act 99-69, § 10 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (adding 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105); Pub. Act 99-258, § 15 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (adding 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105). Subsection (b) of the new sentencing provisions directs that the court \"may, in its discretion, decline to impose any otherwise applicable sentencing enhancement based upon firearm possession, possession with personal discharge, or possession with personal discharge that proximately causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement, or death to another person.\" 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105(b) (West 2016).\n¶ 8 Public Act 99-258 also amended section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act, raising the age for automatic transfer to adult court from 15 years to 16 years and eliminating armed robbery while armed with a firearm and aggravated vehicular hijacking while armed with a firearm from the list of automatic transfer offenses. Pub. Act 99-258 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (amending 705 ILCS 405/5-130(1)(a) ).\n¶ 9 In supplemental briefing in the appellate court, Hunter argued that the amendment to the Code and the new sentencing provisions in the Act applied retroactively and that his case should be remanded for a discretionary transfer hearing, as well as a new sentencing hearing. The appellate court held that neither provision applied retroactively and rejected Hunter's other claims of error, thus affirming his convictions and sentence. Hunter , 2016 IL App (1st) 141904, ¶¶ 20, 22, 62, 73, 80, 407 Ill.Dec. 1, 62 N.E.3d 246. We allowed Hunter's petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Mar. 15, 2016).\n¶ 10 No. 121345-People v. Wilson\n¶ 11 In October 2012, defendant Drashun Wilson was indicted for attempted first degree murder ( 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a) (West 2012)) and aggravated battery with a firearm ( 720 ILCS 5/12-3.05(e)(1) (West 2012)) in connection with the September 23, 2012, shooting of Floyd Fulton. At the time of the offenses and indictment, Wilson was 17 years old and, under the Act, was tried in adult court. See 705 ILCS 405/5-120 (West 2012). Following a jury trial in the circuit court of Cook County, Wilson was found guilty of both offenses. The jury also found that Wilson personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused great bodily harm to another person. After merging the aggravated battery conviction into the attempted murder conviction, the trial court sentenced Wilson to 31 years' imprisonment-the 6-year minimum for a Class X felony, plus the minimum mandatory 25-year firearm enhancement applicable where the defendant personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused great bodily harm. See 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(D) (West 2012); 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-25(a) (West 2012). Wilson appealed.\n¶ 12 While Wilson's case was pending in the appellate court, Public Acts 99-69 and 99-258 became effective. In supplemental briefing, Wilson argued that he was entitled to be resentenced under section 5-4.5-105(b) of the Code, under which the trial court could decline to impose the firearm enhancement. The appellate court held that section 5-4.5-105(b) applied prospectively only. Wilson , 2016 IL App (1st) 141500, ¶ 16, 407 Ill.Dec. 84, 62 N.E.3d 329. The appellate court rejected Wilson's other claims of error and affirmed his conviction and sentence. Id. ¶¶ 1, 28, 35, 43, 46-47.\n¶ 13 We allowed Wilson's petition for leave to appeal ( Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Mar. 15, 2016)) and consolidated Wilson's and Hunter's appeals for review.\n¶ 14 ANALYSIS\n¶ 15 Whether the statutory amendments at issue here apply retroactively to defendants' cases presents an issue of statutory construction. As such, our review proceeds de novo . People ex rel. Madigan v. J.T. Einoder, Inc. , 2015 IL 117193, ¶ 27, 390 Ill.Dec. 105, 28 N.E.3d 758 ; People v. Amigon , 239 Ill. 2d 71, 84, 346 Ill.Dec. 63, 940 N.E.2d 63 (2010).\n¶ 16 I\n¶ 17 We consider first the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act, adopted in Public Act 99-258. As noted above, the amendment changed the requirements for automatic transfer of a juvenile to adult court, by raising the minimum age from 15 years to 16 years and by eliminating armed robbery while armed with a firearm and aggravated vehicular hijacking while armed with a firearm from the list of automatic transfer offenses. Hunter was charged with both of these offenses. Relying on People ex rel. Alvarez v. Howard , 2016 IL 120729, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346, Hunter argues that the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) applies retroactively to his case, and because the offenses with which he was charged are no longer qualifying offenses for automatic transfer to adult court, he requests remand to the juvenile court for a discretionary transfer hearing but for purposes of sentencing only. Hunter does not challenge his conviction.\n¶ 18 Howard was decided after we granted Hunter's petition for leave to appeal. There, we addressed the retroactivity of the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) adopted in Public Act 99-258. Although Howard involved the change in the minimum age requirement for transfer to adult court, rather than the change in the list of automatic transfer offenses that is at issue here, both changes appear in the same section of the Act. Thus, Howard informs our analysis in this case.\n¶ 19 In Howard , the defendant, who was 15 years old, was indicted on multiple offenses, including first degree murder. The charges against defendant were brought in adult court, pursuant to section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act ( 705 ILCS 405/5-130(1)(a) (West 2014)). Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 4, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346. While the defendant's case was pending in the trial court, Public Act 99-258 became effective. The defendant argued that his case must proceed in juvenile court because he no longer met the minimum age requirement for transfer to adult court. The trial court agreed and transferred the cause to juvenile court. The State sought a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to rescind the transfer order. We denied the writ. Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶¶ 35-36, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346.\n¶ 20 In Howard , we reviewed the proper analysis courts must employ when determining the temporal reach of a statute. We noted that this court adopted the United States Supreme Court's retroactivity analysis set forth in Landgraf v. USI Film Products , 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 19, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346 (citing Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Will County Collector , 196 Ill. 2d 27, 36-39, 255 Ill.Dec. 482, 749 N.E.2d 964 (2001) ). Under Landgraf , we first ask whether the legislature has clearly indicated the statute's temporal reach. If so, and assuming no constitutional prohibition, the legislature's intent will be given effect. Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 19, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346. If the legislature's intent is not clear, then, under Landgraf , the court must determine whether the statute has a retroactive impact, i.e. , whether the statute \"would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. (quoting Commonwealth Edison , 196 Ill. 2d at 38, 255 Ill.Dec. 482, 749 N.E.2d 964, quoting Landgraf , 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483 ). \"If there is no retroactive impact, the statutory amendment may be applied retroactively; if there is a retroactive impact, the court presumes that the legislature intended the amendment to be prospective only.\" Id.\n¶ 21 Howard made plain, however, that based on section 4 of the Statute on Statutes ( 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2014) ), Illinois courts need never go beyond the first step of the Landgraf analysis. Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 20, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346. Section 4 of the Statute on Statutes, which has never been amended since its adoption in 1874 (see Ill. Rev. Stat. 1874, ch. 131, § 4 (Hurd 1874)) states:\n\"No new law shall be construed to repeal a former law, whether such former law is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense committed against the former law, or as to any act done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred, or any right accrued, or claim arising under the former law, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued, or claim arising before the new law takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform, so far as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such proceeding. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provisions of a new law, such provision may, by the consent of the party affected, be applied to any judgment pronounced after the new law takes effect. This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or by implication, whether the repeal is in the act making any new provision upon the same subject or in any other act.\" 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2016).\n¶ 22 As Howard explained, section 4 \"is a general savings clause, which this court has interpreted as meaning that procedural changes to statutes will be applied retroactively, while substantive changes are prospective only.\" Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 20, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346 (citing People v. Glisson , 202 Ill. 2d 499, 506-07, 270 Ill.Dec. 57, 782 N.E.2d 251 (2002) ). Thus, if the temporal reach of the statute is not clearly indicated in its text, then the statute's temporal reach is provided by default in section 4 of the Statute on Statutes. Id.\n¶ 23 Applying this analysis to Public Act 99-258, Howard noted that the portion of the public act amending section 5-130(1)(a) did not indicate its temporal reach, thus requiring resort to the default rule in section 4 of the Statute on Statutes. Id. ¶¶ 21, 28. We agreed with the parties that the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a), impacting whether a defendant is tried in juvenile or criminal court, is purely a matter of procedure and concluded that, in the absence of a constitutional impediment to retroactive application, the amendment applies to \"pending cases,\" including the defendant's case. Id.\n¶ 24 Howard rejected the State's argument that applying the amended statute to the defendant's case, which had been pending in adult court for three years, would run afoul of section 4's requirement that procedural changes only apply \"so far as practicable\" ( 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2014) ). Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 32, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346. We observed that transferring the defendant's case to juvenile court for a transfer hearing \"is something that is feasible.\" Id.\n¶ 25 Hunter argues that, like Howard , his case was also \"pending\" on the effective date of the amendment, albeit on direct review in the appellate court. Hunter posits that because our retroactivity jurisprudence does not distinguish between cases pending in the trial court and cases pending on direct review when a statutory amendment becomes effective, Howard requires remand of his case to the juvenile court for a discretionary transfer hearing.\n¶ 26 The State counters that this court's statement in Howard that the amendment applies retroactively to \"pending cases\" does not mean that it applies broadly to all nonfinal cases, i.e. , cases that are pending on direct review. The State argues that the amendment only applies retroactively to cases pending in criminal court that are capable of conforming to the new statute. The State maintains that applying the amendment to cases pending on direct review would result in an absurdity, requiring a remand in every such case where the legislature made an intervening change to a trial court procedure. The State further argues that even if the amendment applies retroactively to cases that were pending on direct review at the time the amendment became effective, remand to the juvenile court for a discretionary transfer hearing in this case is not practicable because Hunter, who is now 22 years old, has aged out of the juvenile court system.\n¶ 27 We agree with Hunter that our retroactivity jurisprudence has not typically distinguished between cases that are pending in the trial court and cases pending in the appellate court on direct review at the time a statutory amendment becomes effective. The same retroactivity analysis that we employed in Howard , where the defendant's case was pending in the trial court when the amendment became effective, has also been employed by this court where the defendant's case was pending in the appellate court at the time the amendment became effective. See Glisson , 202 Ill. 2d at 508-09, 270 Ill.Dec. 57, 782 N.E.2d 251 (holding that the general savings clause of section 4 of the Statute on Statutes prohibited retroactive application of a substantive statutory amendment that went into effect while the defendant's case was pending on appeal); accord People v. Atkins , 217 Ill. 2d 66, 71-73, 298 Ill.Dec. 50, 838 N.E.2d 943 (2005) (holding that under section 4 of the Statute on Statutes, a substantive amendment that became effective after the defendant was convicted and sentenced would not apply retroactively).\n¶ 28 Our agreement with Hunter on this point, however, does not lead us to conclude that, pursuant to section 4 of the Statute on Statutes and our decision in Howard , remand for further proceedings is mandated in this case. The process of statutory construction requires more than mechanical application of a rule of law or a decision of this court. We have an obligation to construe statutes in a manner that will avoid absurd, unreasonable, or unjust results that the legislature could not have intended. People ex rel. Alvarez v. Gaughan , 2016 IL 120110, ¶ 19, 410 Ill.Dec. 890, 72 N.E.3d 276 ; Illinois State Treasurer v. Illinois Workers' Compensation Comm'n , 2015 IL 117418, ¶ 39, 391 Ill.Dec. 18, 30 N.E.3d 288. As we recently observed, \"the process of statutory construction should not be divorced from consideration of real-world results.\" People v. Fort , 2017 IL 118966, ¶ 35, 417 Ill.Dec. 566, 88 N.E.3d 718. Here, Hunter's construction of the amended statute would lead to real-world results that the legislature could not have intended.\n¶ 29 We return to the Howard case, on which Hunter relies. Although we stated in Howard that the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act applies to \"pending cases\" ( Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 28, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346 ), we did not elaborate as to what that term means in the context of applying the default rule of section 4 of the Statute on Statutes. Certainly, we were not asked in Howard to consider the retroactivity of a procedural statute where, as here, the case was pending in the appellate court, rather than the trial court, when the statute became effective.\n¶ 30 We also observe that our application of section 4 in the Howard case began with this statement of the law: \"Under section 4, substantive amendments may not be applied retroactively, but 'procedural law changes will apply to ongoing proceedings .' \" (Emphasis added.) Id. (quoting People v. Ziobro , 242 Ill. 2d 34, 46, 350 Ill.Dec. 839, 949 N.E.2d 631 (2011) (citing section 4 of the Statute on Statutes ( 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2006) ))). In Howard , the trial court proceedings had not yet been concluded. In a real-world sense those proceedings were \"ongoing.\" Indeed, we framed the question in Howard as whether, given the statutory amendment, the defendant should \"continue\" to be prosecuted in adult court. Id. ¶ 31. Application of the Statute on Statute's default rule meant that the amended statute, changing the requirements for automatic transfer to adult court, would apply retroactively to a pending case, i.e. , a case in which the trial court proceedings had begun under the old statute but had not yet been concluded.\n¶ 31 Howard is consistent with the language of section 4 of the Statute on Statutes, which requires that \"the proceedings thereafter \"-after the adoption of the new procedural statute-\"shall conform, so far as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such proceeding.\" (Emphasis added.) 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2016). Section 4 contemplates the existence of proceedings after the new or amended statute is effective to which the new procedure could apply. The phrase \"ongoing proceedings,\" used by this court in Ziobro and Howard , conveys this idea. See also People v. Zito , 237 Ill. 434, 438, 86 N.E. 1041 (1908) (under section 4, \"what remained to be done\" must conform to the mode of procedure under the new act).\n¶ 32 In Hunter's case, however, the proceedings in the trial court were completed well before the statute was amended. No \"ongoing proceedings\" exist to which the amended statute could apply. Thus, in contrast to Howard , this is not a case where we must decide whether the defendant should \"continue\" to be prosecuted in adult court. This is also not a case where remand for further proceedings is necessitated by reversible error at trial. See Ziobro , 242 Ill. 2d at 45-46, 350 Ill.Dec. 839, 949 N.E.2d 631 (where, after reversing the trial court's dismissal of the criminal charges, we instructed that a new procedural statute would apply retroactively to the proceedings on remand). Although Hunter challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on direct review, the appellate court rejected that argument ( Hunter , 2016 IL App (1st) 141904, ¶¶ 13-20, 407 Ill.Dec. 1, 62 N.E.3d 246 ), and Hunter does not press that claim, or any other claim of reversible error, in this court. Simply stated, there are no \"proceedings thereafter\" capable of \"conform[ing]\" to the amended statute. 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2016). Nothing remains to be done.\n¶ 33 Because Hunter's trial court proceedings have been concluded, and no further trial court proceedings are necessitated by reversible error, applying the amended statute retroactively to Hunter's case would result in this court effectively creating new proceedings for the sole purpose of applying a procedural statute that postdates his trial and sentence. We have grave concerns about such a result.\n¶ 34 The Landgraf opinion, from which our retroactivity jurisprudence sprang, speaks to this issue. There, the Supreme Court observed that procedural rules may often be applied in cases that arose before the rule was enacted. Landgraf , 511 U.S. at 275, 114 S.Ct. 1483. The Court, however, went on to note:\n\"Of course, the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending case. A new rule concerning the filing of complaints would not govern an action in which the complaint had already been properly filed under the old regime, and the promulgation of a new rule of evidence would not require an appellate remand for a new trial.\" Id. n.29.\n¶ 35 Justice Scalia, in his concurrence, made a similar observation:\n\"A new rule of evidence governing expert testimony, for example, is aimed at regulating the conduct of trial, and the event relevant to retroactivity of the rule is introduction of the testimony. Even though it is a procedural rule, it would unquestionably not be applied to testimony already taken -reversing a case on appeal, for example, because the new rule had not been applied at a trial which antedated the statute.\" (Emphasis in original.) Id. at 291-92, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (Scalia, J., concurring, joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ.).\nSee also Michael S. Gilmore, Application of Statutory Changes to Cases in Progress: The Crossroads of the Legislative and Judicial Power-An Analysis of Federal and Idaho Law , 34 Idaho L. Rev. 517, 543 (1998) (reviewing Justice Scalia's concurrence in Landgraf and noting that if procedural rule changes were truly applied retroactively \"there would be retrial of cases every time new statutes governing pleadings, appeals, and evidence\" were adopted that \"would lead to different results from the old statutes\").\n¶ 36 We recognize that our retroactivity jurisprudence, though flowing from Landgraf , was tempered by our construction of section 4 of the Statute on Statutes, and we presume that the General Assembly adopted Public Act 99-258 with knowledge of section 4 and this court's interpretation thereof. See People v. Villa , 2011 IL 110777, ¶ 36, 355 Ill.Dec. 220, 959 N.E.2d 634 ; People v. Jones , 214 Ill. 2d 187, 199, 291 Ill.Dec. 663, 824 N.E.2d 239 (2005). But in none of the several cases from this court on which Hunter relies did we remand a case to the trial court because \"the new [procedural] rule had not been applied at a trial which antedated the statute.\" Landgraf , 511 U.S. at 291-92, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (Scalia, J., concurring, joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ.). Remand under such circumstances would create inconvenience and a waste of judicial resources-a real-world result that the General Assembly could not have intended. Accordingly, we will not apply the amended statute retroactively to Hunter's case.\n¶ 37 We reject Hunter's argument for retroactive application for the further reason that new procedural rules only apply to ongoing proceedings \"so far as practicable.\" 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2016). We agree with the State that under the facts of this case, application of the amended statute is not practicable.\n¶ 38 Howard equated what is \"practicable\" to what is \"feasible\" and concluded in that case that transfer to the juvenile court for a transfer hearing was feasible, even if not convenient. Howard , 2016 IL 120729, ¶ 32, 410 Ill.Dec. 960, 72 N.E.3d 346. At the time of our decision in Howard , the defendant was 19 years old and still subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. See People v. Fiveash , 2015 IL 117669, ¶¶ 14-16, 396 Ill.Dec. 98, 39 N.E.3d 924 (scope of the Act is limited to persons under the age of 21, and therefore, the juvenile court had no authority over the 23-year-old defendant). Hunter is now 22 years old. A discretionary transfer hearing in the juvenile court is no longer feasible because the juvenile court may not exercise jurisdiction over Hunter. Id.\n¶ 39 We disagree with Hunter that, pursuant to Fort , 2017 IL 118966, 417 Ill.Dec. 566, 88 N.E.3d 718, and People v. Brown , 225 Ill. 2d 188, 310 Ill.Dec. 561, 866 N.E.2d 1163 (2007), retroactive application of the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) is yet feasible, despite his age.\n¶ 40 In Fort , the juvenile defendant was tried in adult court for first degree murder, an automatic transfer offense, but convicted of second degree murder, which is not an automatic transfer offense. We held that plain error occurred when the trial court sentenced the defendant as an adult under the Unified Code of Corrections without the State first filing a motion requesting adult sentencing, as required by the Act ( 705 ILCS 405/5-130(1)(c)(ii) (West 2008)). Fort , 2017 IL 118966, ¶¶ 30-31, 417 Ill.Dec. 566, 88 N.E.3d 718. We determined that the appropriate remedy was to vacate the defendant's sentence and remand the matter to the trial court where the State would have the opportunity to file an appropriate motion for adult sentencing. Id. ¶ 41. We noted: \"Should the trial court find after the hearing that defendant is not subject to adult sentencing, the proper remedy is to discharge the proceedings against defendant since he is now over 21 years of age and is no longer eligible to be committed as a juvenile under the Act.\" Id.\n¶ 41 In contrast to Fort , where the case was remanded to adult court to allow the State to file a motion in that court requesting adult sentencing, Hunter seeks remand for a discretionary transfer hearing, which, he acknowledges, proceeds in the juvenile court. See 705 ILCS 405/5-805(3)(a) (West 2016). But as already noted, Hunter, who is 22 years old, is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\n¶ 42 In Brown , on which Hunter also relies, the juvenile defendant was tried and convicted in adult court for attempted murder. Several years later, he filed a successive postconviction petition challenging his conviction because the statute under which his case had been transferred to adult court was found unconstitutional. We held that, because the statute was unconstitutional and void ab initio , the defendant's transfer to adult court based on that statute was also void and the defendant was thus entitled to a new transfer hearing. Brown , 225 Ill. 2d at 199, 310 Ill.Dec. 561, 866 N.E.2d 1163. Although the defendant would have been 25 or 26 years old at the time we remanded the matter to the circuit court, the State apparently made no argument challenging the remand based on the defendant's age. Brown 's silence on an issue that was not raised does not lend support to Hunter's position here that a remand to the juvenile court for a discretionary transfer hearing is feasible, notwithstanding that the juvenile court cannot exercise jurisdiction over a 22-year-old defendant.\n¶ 43 In sum, because the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act did not become effective until after Hunter's trial court proceedings were concluded and his case was pending in the appellate court; because no reversible error necessitates remand for further proceedings to which the amended statute could apply; and because Hunter, in any event, is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, making remand impracticable, we hold that the amendment to section 5-130(1)(a) of the Act does not apply retroactively to Hunter's case.\n¶ 44 II\n¶ 45 We next consider the new juvenile sentencing provisions in the Code, adopted in Public Acts 99-69 and 99-258. Both public acts adopted identical provisions titled \"SENTENCING OF INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 AT THE TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF AN OFFENSE.\" Pub. Act 99-69, § 10 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (adding 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105); Pub. Act 99-258, § 15 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (also adding 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105). The new provisions state in relevant part:\n\"(a) On or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, when a person commits an offense and the person is under 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, the court, at the sentencing hearing conducted under Section 5-4-1, shall consider the following additional factors [enumerated 1 through 9] in mitigation in determining the appropriate sentence:\n* * *\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the court may sentence the defendant to any disposition authorized for the class of the offense of which he or she was found guilty as described in Article 4.5 of this Code, and may, in its discretion, decline to impose any otherwise applicable sentencing enhancement based upon firearm possession, possession with personal discharge, or possession with personal discharge that proximately causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement, or death to another person.\" 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105 (West 2016).\n¶ 46 Section 5-4.5-105 of the Code became effective while defendants' cases were pending in the appellate court on direct review. In each case, the appellate court rejected the defendant's argument that subsection (b), which gives the court discretion not to impose otherwise mandatory firearm enhancements, applies retroactively to his case. Hunter , 2016 IL App (1st) 141904, ¶ 43, 407 Ill.Dec. 1, 62 N.E.3d 246 ; Wilson , 2016 IL App (1st) 141500, ¶ 16, 407 Ill.Dec. 84, 62 N.E.3d 329. In Hunter's case, the appellate court held that the legislature clearly indicated in subsection (a) that the new provisions apply to sentencing hearings \" '[o]n or after the effective date' \" of the statute, January 1, 2016. Hunter , 2016 IL App (1st) 141904, ¶ 43, 407 Ill.Dec. 1, 62 N.E.3d 246. In Wilson's case, the appellate court also relied on the language in subsection (a), holding that a sentencing court's consideration of the additional mitigating factors set forth in subsection (a) and the sentencing court's discretion not to impose a firearm enhancement as set forth in subsection (b) may be exercised only when an individual that is under 18 years of age commits an offense on or after the effective date of the statute-January 1, 2016. Wilson , 2016 IL App (1st) 141500, ¶ 16, 407 Ill.Dec. 84, 62 N.E.3d 329.\n¶ 47 Defendants argue that the appellate court erred in applying the language in subsection (a), which limits its temporal reach, to subsection (b). According to defendants, the legislature's decision to omit such limiting language from subsection (b) means that the legislature intended subsection (b) to apply retroactively. The State counters that section 5-4.5-105 establishes a comprehensive sentencing scheme, and that the legislature's expression of temporal reach in subsection (a) applies to the entire scheme.\n¶ 48 Under our well-settled rules of statutory construction, \"where the legislature includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same statute, courts will presume that the legislature acted intentionally in the exclusion or inclusion\" ( People v. Smith , 2016 IL 119659, ¶ 30, 412 Ill.Dec. 793, 76 N.E.3d 1251 ) and that the legislature intended different results ( In re K.C. , 186 Ill. 2d 542, 549-50, 239 Ill.Dec. 572, 714 N.E.2d 491 (1999) ). Here, the fact that the legislature included language in subsection (a) limiting its temporal reach but omitted such language in subsection (b) is indicative that the legislature intended different results and that the limiting language in subsection (a) applies only to that subsection. Thus, only the trial court's obligation set forth in subsection (a) to consider additional factors in mitigation at sentencing is controlled by the limiting language in that same subsection.\n¶ 49 Had the legislature intended all of the new sentencing provisions to have the same temporal reach as the provisions in subsection (a), the legislature could have included the limiting language in a separate subsection so stating, as it did in connection with another amendment adopted as part of the same public act. See Pub. Act 99-258, § 5 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (amending 705 ILCS 405/5-805, adding 705 ILCS 405/5-805(7) (\"[t]he changes made to this Section * * * apply to a minor who has been taken into custody on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act\")). The legislature, however, did not do so with respect to the new juvenile sentencing provisions.\n¶ 50 The legislature also could have preceded all of the subsections of the new statute with a statement indicating that all of the new provisions have the same temporal reach, as it did when it added another new section to the Act. See Pub. Act 99-258, § 5 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (adding 705 ILCS 405/5-822 (providing, prior to the numbered paragraphs, for data collection to commence \"[o]n the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly\")). The legislature did not do so.\n¶ 51 We presume that the legislature acted intentionally when it included the limiting language in subsection (a) but omitted that same language in subsection (b), and we therefore agree with defendants that the appellate court erred in applying the language in subsection (a) to subsection (b). That said, we disagree with defendants that the omission of that language in subsection (b) means that the legislature must have intended that subsection (b) apply retroactively to cases that were pending on direct review when the statute became effective. Just as we will not read the limiting language of subsection (a) into subsection (b), neither will we inject into the statute an unexpressed provision requiring retroactive application of subsection (b). See King v. First Capital Financial Services Corp. , 215 Ill. 2d 1, 26, 293 Ill.Dec. 657, 828 N.E.2d 1155 (2005) (courts may not, in the guise of statutory construction, annex new provisions not expressed by the legislature).\n¶ 52 Because the statute is silent as to the temporal reach of subsection (b), we once again refer to section 4 of the Statute on Statutes. Although the parties dispute whether subsection (b) is properly labeled \"procedural\" or \"substantive,\" we need not decide that issue. Rather, we agree with the State that, under section 4, subsection (b) of the new statute cannot apply to Hunter and Wilson, who were sentenced before the statute took effect.\n¶ 53 The second sentence of section 4 of the Statute on Statutes expressly provides:\n\"If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provisions of a new law, such provision may, by the consent of the party affected, be applied to any judgment pronounced after the new law takes effect.\" 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 2016).\n¶ 54 In People v. Hansen , 28 Ill. 2d 322, 340-41, 192 N.E.2d 359 (1963), we held that the defendant was not entitled to be resentenced under the new criminal code, which went into effect just 13 days after he was sentenced, because, under section 4, \"a punishment mitigated by a new law is applicable only to judgments after the new law takes effect.\" Similarly, in People v. Bradford , 106 Ill. 2d 492, 504, 88 Ill.Dec. 615, 478 N.E.2d 1341 (1985), we held that, under section 4, the defendant was not eligible to be sentenced under a statutory amendment that became effective while his case was pending in this court because he had already been sentenced prior to the statute's effective date. Where, however, a defendant's sentence is vacated on appeal and the matter remanded for resentencing, under section 4 of the Statute on Statutes, the defendant may elect to be sentenced under the law in effect at the time of the new sentencing hearing. People v. Reyes , 2016 IL 119271, ¶ 12, 407 Ill.Dec. 452, 63 N.E.3d 884 (per curiam ) (vacating the defendant's sentence as unconstitutional and remanding to the trial court where, pursuant to section 4 of the Statute on Statutes, the defendant was entitled to be resentenced under the new juvenile sentencing provisions).\n¶ 55 Here, no dispute exists that defendants were sentenced well before the new juvenile sentencing provisions, including subsection (b), became effective on January 1, 2016. Further, defendants make no claim that error occurred in the trial court that would require vacatur of their sentences and remand for resentencing, thus giving them the option to be sentenced under subsection (b).\n¶ 56 Defendants' sole argument against applying the second sentence of section 4 in the present case is that subsection (b) of the new statute does not mitigate punishment. We disagree. To \"mitigate\" means \"to make less severe.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1447 (1993); see Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (10th ed. 2014). Subsection (b) provides that the trial court \"may, in its discretion, decline to impose any other applicable [firearm] sentencing enhancement.\" 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-105(b) (West 2016). Thus, in the case of Hunter, who was found guilty of aggravated vehicular hijacking, aggravated kidnapping, and armed robbery, all while armed with a firearm, application of subsection (b) would mean that the low end of the sentencing range would be reduced from 21 years (the 6-year minimum sentence for a Class X felony, plus the mandatory 15-year firearm enhancement) to 6 years (the minimum unenhanced sentence for a Class X felony). In the case of Wilson, who was found guilty of attempted first degree murder where he personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused great bodily harm, application of subsection (b) would mean that the low end of the sentencing range would be reduced from 31 years (the 6-year minimum sentence for a Class X felony, plus the mandatory 25-year minimum firearm enhancement) to 6 years (the minimum unenhanced sentence for a Class X felony). We conclude that subsection (b) of the new juvenile sentencing provisions mitigates punishment because the potential sentence is \"less severe\" than under the prior sentencing scheme. Accordingly, defendants are not eligible to be sentenced under subsection (b). The appellate court came to the correct conclusions, but for the wrong reasons.\n¶ 57 CONCLUSION\n¶ 58 For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the judgments of the appellate court.\n¶ 59 Affirmed.\nChief Justice Karmeier and Justices Freeman, Thomas, Kilbride, Garman, and Burke concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nNeither public act contains an effective date, but pursuant to the Effective Date of Laws Act (5 ILCS 75/0.01 et seq. (West 2014)), because the underlying bills were both \"passed\" prior to June 1, 2015 (see 5 ILCS 75/3 (West 2014) ), the effective date for both public acts was January 1, 2016 (see 5 ILCS 75/1(a) (West 2014)). See also Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, § 10 (\"The General Assembly shall provide by law for a uniform effective date for laws passed prior to June 1 of a calendar year.\").\nSee Allegis Realty Investors v. Novak , 223 Ill. 2d 318, 333-34, 307 Ill.Dec. 592, 860 N.E.2d 246 (2006) (holding that curative legislation, adopted while the case was on appeal to this court, and which validated the challenged tax levy, applied retroactively under the clear language of the statute); Atkins , 217 Ill. 2d at 71-73, 298 Ill.Dec. 50, 838 N.E.2d 943 (holding that a substantive amendment to the burglary statute, which became effective after the defendant was convicted and sentenced, would not apply retroactively); Glisson , 202 Ill. 2d at 509, 270 Ill.Dec. 57, 782 N.E.2d 251 (holding that substantive statutory amendment repealing the offense of which the defendant was convicted, which went into effect while the defendant's case was pending on appeal, would not apply retroactively); People v.

The plaintiff filed a complaint at law in the circuit court of Lake County against the County of Lake (County) and the city of Highland Park (City) for personal injuries arising out of a bicycling accident on the Skokie Valley Bike Path. Defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment alleging various immunities under the Act. The circuit court allowed both motions and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed the judgment with respect to the City only.\n¶ 2 The appellate court reversed the part of the circuit court's judgment pertaining to the City and remanded the cause to the circuit court. 2016 IL App (2d) 160035, 407 Ill.Dec. 712, 64 N.E.3d 90. The appellate court held that the circuit court erred in holding that the Skokie Valley Bike Path is a riding \"trail\" within the meaning of section 3-107(b) of the Act. Id. ¶ 33. Thus, the City could not assert absolute immunity under section 3-107(b). Id. We affirm the judgment of the appellate court but for different reasons.\n¶ 3 BACKGROUND\n¶ 4 On August 21, 2013, plaintiff, Kathy Corbett, was riding her bicycle with a group of other cyclists on the Skokie Valley Bike Path. The group was riding south on a portion of the path running parallel to Skokie Valley Road (U.S. Route 41), between Park Avenue West and Old Deerfield Road, within the city of Highland Park. Plaintiff alleged that, prior to that date, defendants had been informed of a dangerous condition on that section of the path, in which \"weeds and other vegetation were growing up through the asphalt * * *, causing portions of the path to be broken, bumpy and elevated.\" Plaintiff alleged that she was thrown off her bicycle while riding over the defective portion of the path, causing her to sustain severe injuries. She alleged that her injuries were proximately caused by the willful and wanton acts or omissions of defendants.\n¶ 5 According to documents in the record, at the time of plaintiff's accident the County was a party to a recreational lease agreement over the Skokie Valley Bike Path with Commonwealth Edison (ComEd). ComEd was the owner of the right-of-way encompassing the path, and the County was a tenant. Other documents in the record reveal that the County and the City were parties to a maintenance agreement, which provided that the City was responsible for routine maintenance on the portion of the path within the corporate limits of Highland Park. According to the agreement, \"routine maintenance\" included all activities necessary to keep the path in a reasonably safe and serviceable condition for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.\n¶ 6 In its answer to plaintiff's complaint, the City raised various affirmative defenses , including immunity under section 3-107(b) of the Act. Defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment. Relevant to this appeal, the City asserted in its motion that it was absolutely immune from liability, even for willful and wanton conduct, pursuant to section 3-107(b). That section provides, in part: \"[n]either a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by a condition of: * * * (b) Any hiking, riding, fishing or hunting trail.\" 745 ILCS 10/3-107(b) (West 2012). The City attached several exhibits in support of its motion. The exhibits included deposition transcripts of plaintiff and other witnesses.\n¶ 7 Plaintiff testified in her deposition that, on the date of the accident, she was riding her bicycle with a group of people with whom she regularly rode. She had previously ridden on the particular stretch of path where the accident occurred. Plaintiff testified that section of the path was surrounded by shrubs and wild grasses. It was separated from residences and commercial businesses and set back from the highway. Plaintiff testified that the group was riding south on the path at a speed of 15 to 17 miles per hour as they approached a stop sign at Old Deerfield Road. The rider two places in front of her, Hasan Syed, hit a bump, lost control of his bicycle, and crashed. Plaintiff testified that the rider directly in front of her veered off, but she was not able to do so. Instead, she rode over Syed and flew off her bicycle, landing on the asphalt and sustaining multiple injuries.\n¶ 8 Yves Roubaud testified in his deposition that he was riding with plaintiff and the others on August 21, 2013. He described the path as a bicycle path used by cyclists and walkers for recreational purposes. It had a yellow dividing line on it. Roubaud testified that the stretch of the path where the accident occurred was separated from residences and commercial businesses and set back from the highway. Roubaud stated that he was riding between Syed and plaintiff when Syed fell to the ground. Roubaud stated that he swerved to the left and rolled over Syed's leg but did not fall down. He then turned around and saw plaintiff lying on the ground, moaning in pain.\n¶ 9 In his deposition, Syed testified that the path was used for recreational bicyclists riding at slow speeds and for walkers. He stated that the path was not intended to be used by professional riders but was \"just for fun.\" Syed stated that the path had shrubs on both sides. Syed testified consistently with plaintiff and Roubaud regarding the events surrounding plaintiff's accident.\n¶ 10 John Stevens testified in his deposition that he was riding with plaintiff and the others on August 21, 2013. He described the path as approximately six feet wide, paved with asphalt, and \"lined by some type of growth most of the way, whether hedges or bushes.\" He stated that the path was not connected to any particular park. He also testified that the path was separated from commercial businesses and from traffic other than bicycles, walkers, and runners.\n¶ 11 In her response to the City's motion for summary judgment, plaintiff argued that the path is not a \"riding trail\" under section 3-107(b) of the Act because it is paved and runs through a busy, developed commercial and industrial area of the city rather than a forest or mountainous region. Plaintiff attached her affidavit, in which she averred that she was familiar with the exact location on the path where the incident occurred, having ridden her bicycle through the area many times. She also attached photographs in support of her statements describing the path.\n¶ 12 Plaintiff alleged the following facts. The path is not located in a wooded, natural scenic area. The path passes by a city park called Buckthorn Park. At the specific location where the accident occurred, there are commercial and industrial businesses, parking lots, and buildings abutting both sides of the path. Many of the businesses have cyclone fences that are adjacent to the path. Behind these fences are stacks of industrial materials such as pipes and cement blocks. There are some large bushes and grass but no trees present in the area where the incident occurred. Near the site of the accident, the path intersects with Old Deerfield Road, which is a busy city street with motor vehicles regularly crossing the path. As bicyclists approach the road from the north and south, there are stop signs for the bicyclists but no stop signs for the cars. The path is sandwiched between U.S. Route 41, which is less than one block to the east, and railroad tracks, which are less than one block to the west. There are large ComEd utility poles that run alongside the entire path, with multiple power lines overhead.\n¶ 13 In its reply, the City did not dispute the facts averred by plaintiff. It argued, however, that the decisions of neighboring landowners to develop their property and the fact that the path is adjacent to a road did not defeat the immunity conferred by section 3-107(b) of the Act. The City argued that the nature of the path itself is determinative of whether it is a \"riding trail\" under section 3-107(b). The City contended that the undisputed evidence, i.e. , that the path is surrounded by grass, shrubs, hedges, and bushes, shows that it is a \"riding trail\" as contemplated by section 3-107(b).\n¶ 14 The circuit court allowed both defendants' motions and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, plaintiff did not challenge the judgment for the County. She argued that the grant of summary judgment for the City was error because the path was not a \"riding trail,\" as that term has been construed by the appellate court.\n¶ 15 The appellate court reversed the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the City and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. 2016 IL App (2d) 160035, ¶¶ 33-34, 407 Ill.Dec. 712, 64 N.E.3d 90 (affirming in part and reversing in part the circuit court's judgment). The appellate court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the judicially accepted definition of the word \"trail\" is \" 'a \"marked path through a forest or mountainous region.\" ' \" Id. ¶¶ 23, 29 (quoting Brown v. Cook County Forest Preserve , 284 Ill. App. 3d 1098, 1101, 220 Ill.Dec. 471, 673 N.E.2d 383 (1996), quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2423 (1981)). The court concluded that the presence of industrial and residential development completely surrounding the path defeated the City's argument that it runs through a forest or mountainous region. 2016 IL App (2d) 160035, ¶¶ 29-30, 407 Ill.Dec. 712, 64 N.E.3d 90. Therefore, the immunity provided by section 3-107(b) did not apply. Id.\n¶ 16 This court allowed the City's petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 315. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff. Mar. 15, 2016). We also allowed the Park District Risk Management Agency to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of the City.\n¶ 17 ANALYSIS\n¶ 18 This appeal requires us to review the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the City. Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and other matters on file establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 735 ILCS 5/2-1005(c) (West 2012). This court reviews the circuit court's summary judgment ruling de novo . Bremer v. City of Rockford , 2016 IL 119889, ¶ 20, 412 Ill.Dec. 813, 76 N.E.3d 1271. Issues involving statutory interpretation are questions of law, which are also reviewed de novo . Moon v. Rhode , 2016 IL 119572, ¶ 22, 409 Ill.Dec. 8, 67 N.E.3d 220.\n¶ 19 The circuit court granted summary judgment to the City on the basis that it is immune from liability for plaintiff's injuries under section 3-107(b) of the Act. Section 3-107 of the Act provides, in its entirety:\n\"Neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by a condition of: (a) Any road which provides access to fishing, hunting, or primitive camping, recreational, or scenic areas and which is not a (1) city, town or village street, (2) county, state or federal highway or (3) a township or other road district highway. (b) Any hiking, riding, fishing or hunting trail .\" (Emphases added.) 745 ILCS 10/3-107 (West 2012).\n¶ 20 There is no question that, if section 3-107(b) applies, the City is completely immune from liability, even for willful and wanton conduct. See DeSmet v. County of Rock Island , 219 Ill. 2d 497, 514, 302 Ill.Dec. 466, 848 N.E.2d 1030 (2006) (when the plain language of an immunity provision in the Act contains no exception for willful and wanton conduct, it means that the legislature intended to immunize both negligence and willful and wanton conduct). Furthermore, there is no dispute that plaintiff's injury was caused by a condition of the path. The parties disagree, however, as to whether the Skokie Valley Bike Path is a \"trail\" within the meaning of section 3-107(b). The statute itself does not provide a definition of the term.\n¶ 21 Before addressing the meaning of the statutory language, we note that the Skokie Valley Bike Path is considered a \"shared-use trail\" by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). IDOT is the state agency responsible for officially designating bikeways throughout the state pursuant to the Bikeway Act. 605 ILCS 30/2 (West 2012). Manuals published by IDOT provide that a shared-use trail is physically separated from the roadway and intended for use by bicycles and other non-motorized forms of transportation, including pedestrians, disabled persons in wheelchairs, and in-line skaters. See Illinois Department of Transportation, Bureau of Design and Environment Manual, 17-1.01 (2011); Illinois Department of Transportation, Bureau of Local Roads and Streets Manual, 42-1.01 (2013).\n¶ 22 The Skokie Valley Bike Path, in particular, is a type of shared-use path called a \"rail-with-trail\" because it runs parallel to train tracks located about 40 feet to the west of the path. Skokie Valley Trail (Lake County) Illinois, TrailLink by Rails-toTrails Conservancy , https://www.traillink.com/trail/skokie-valley-trail-(lake-county)/ (last visited Nov. 14, 2017). Running parallel to the path on the east side is U.S. Route 41. The path is approximately 10 miles long and paved with asphalt. It runs from the village of Lake Bluff at the northern end to the city of Highland Park at the southern end. Id. There are several major road crossings, which are marked and include crosswalks. The path has a yellow, painted line dividing it into two lanes and has signs with mile markers for users of the path. Because the path shares a right-of-way with ComEd, high-voltage electrical wires run overhead along the entire path. Id. The path connects to other shared-use paths, including the North Shore Bike Trail, the Des Plaines River Trail, and the Robert McClory Bike Path. Id.\n¶ 23 The appellate court below concluded that the Skokie Valley Bike Path was not a \"trail\" within the meaning of section 3-107(b). In so holding, the appellate court relied on the analytical framework adopted in a previous case, Brown v. Cook County Forest Preserve , 284 Ill. App. 3d 1098, 220 Ill.Dec. 471, 673 N.E.2d 383 (1996). In Brown , the court determined the meaning of the word \"trail\" in the statute by reference to a dictionary. The dictionary definition chosen by the court defined a \"trail\" as a \" 'marked path through a forest or mountainous region.' \" Id. at 1101, 220 Ill.Dec. 471, 673 N.E.2d 383 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2423 (1981)). The Brown court held that, since that the bicycle path at issue in that case ran through a forest or a \"natural and scenic wooded area[ ],\" it was a \"riding trail\" under section 3-107(b). Id. The fact that the path was paved did not alter the court's analysis since, according to the court, the only relevant characteristic of the path was that it traversed a forested area. Id.\n¶ 24 The appellate court in this case used the same analytical framework as the Brown court, holding:\n\"the case law that we follow does require that, to be within section 3-107(b), a path not only be used by bicyclists (or hikers or both) but be located within a ' \"forest or mountainous region\" ' [Citations.] As a matter of law, this restriction defeats the City's assertion that the path is a riding or hiking trail. No contention has been made that the path is located in a mountainous region (mountains being scarce in Lake County). No serious contention can be made that the path is located in a forest; no reasonable person who views the photographs of the path and its surroundings, or even reads their descriptions by those who have seen them, would describe those surroundings as a forest. The path is bordered by narrow bands of greenway that sport some shrubs and a few trees; these narrow bands are surrounded by industrial development, residential neighborhoods, parking lots, railroad tracks, and major vehicular thoroughfares (to the east and south of the area of the accident). The case for considering the path a riding trail would not succeed even if utility poles could be considered trees with power lines for branches.\" ( Emphasis in original.) 2016 IL App (2d) 160035, ¶ 29, 407 Ill.Dec. 712, 64 N.E.3d 90.\nAccordingly, under the appellate court's approach, the application of the statute and the existence of blanket immunity turn on whether the trail runs through a forest or \"natural and scenic wooded area.\"\n¶ 25 Without expressing any view on the correctness of the result in the Brown case, we believe the analytical framework adopted by that court was misguided. First, when using a dictionary to help determine statutory meaning, it is appropriate to use one in existence at the time of the statute's enactment. See Sayles v. Thompson , 99 Ill. 2d 122, 125, 75 Ill.Dec. 446, 457 N.E.2d 440 (1983) (\"[t]he meaning of a statute or constitutional provision depends upon the intent of the drafters at the time of its adoption , and it is a long-standing principle of statutory construction that it is the court's duty to ascertain and effectuate that intent\" (emphasis added)). The Brown court used a definition from a dictionary published in 1981, well after section 3-107(b) was enacted in 1965.\n¶ 26 Second, Brown misquoted the definition of the word \"trail\" in the dictionary it cited. The entire definition is \"a blazed or otherwise marked path through a forest or mountainous region.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2423 (1981). From the same dictionary, the word \"blaze\" means \"a mark made on a tree usu. by chipping off a piece of the bark.\" Id. at 232. To \"blaze\" a trail means to \"to mark out (as a path) by making blazes on trees.\" Id. Thus, a \"blazed or otherwise marked path\" is one made by chipping pieces out of trees. In other words, the definition used by Brown has nothing to do with shared-use trails or designated bicycle paths.\n¶ 27 Third, and most importantly, the appellate court in Brown erred in viewing the word \"trail\" outside the context of the statute in order to determine its meaning. It is a \"fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used. [Citations.]\" Deal v. United States , 508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993). \"The terms in a statute are not to be considered in a vacuum.\" M.I.G. Investments, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency , 122 Ill. 2d 392, 400, 119 Ill.Dec. 533, 523 N.E.2d 1 (1988). Rather, the words and phrases in a statute must be construed in light of the statute as a whole, \" 'with each provision construed in connection with every other section.' \" Eden Retirement Center, Inc. v. Department of Revenue , 213 Ill. 2d 273, 291, 290 Ill.Dec. 189, 821 N.E.2d 240 (2004) (quoting Paris v. Feder , 179 Ill. 2d 173, 177, 227 Ill.Dec. 800, 688 N.E.2d 137 (1997) ); 2A Norman Singer & Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 46:5 (7th ed. 2007).\n¶ 28 Instead of considering the meaning of the word \"trail\" in the context of the statute as a whole, the Brown court isolated the word from the statute and assigned to it a definition from a dictionary. But dissecting an individual word or phrase from a statutory provision and mechanically applying to it a dictionary definition is clearly not the best way of ascertaining legislative intent. See Whelan v. County Officers' Electoral Board , 256 Ill. App. 3d 555, 558, 196 Ill.Dec. 297, 629 N.E.2d 842 (1994). As Judge Learned Hand observed:\n\"Of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract, or anything else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.\" Cabell v. Markham , 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1945).\n¶ 29 The appellate court's decision to define the word \"trail\" using a general dictionary definition of the term distorts the meaning of the statute by divorcing the term from its context. Under the appellate court's rationale, a governmental entity is immune from liability for conditions on a trail only if there is sufficient foliage or a certain number of trees surrounding the trail to constitute a \"forest\" or \"scenic wooded area.\" This analysis is both subjective and arbitrary and has nothing to do with whether a governmental entity should be held liable for creating a risk of injury to users of a trail. Nevertheless, although we disagree with the appellate court's analysis, we agree that section 3-107(b) is not intended to apply to a bicycle path like the one in the present case.\n¶ 30 In construing a statute, our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature's intent. People v. Gutman , 2011 IL 110338, ¶ 12, 355 Ill.Dec. 207, 959 N.E.2d 621. The best indicator of that intent is the statutory language, given its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. As we have stated, unless a word in a statutory sentence is defined in the statute, it must be read in context in order to determine its meaning. Accordingly, a word such as \"trail\" in section 3-107(b)\"must be read in the context of the entire sentence in which it appears.\" Skolnick v. Altheimer & Gray , 191 Ill. 2d 214, 229, 246 Ill.Dec. 324, 730 N.E.2d 4 (2000).\n¶ 31 Section 3-107(b) does not state that immunity applies to an injury caused by a condition of \"any riding trail.\" Rather, it provides that immunity applies to an injury caused by a condition of \"[a]ny hiking, riding, fishing or hunting trail.\" 745 ILCS 10/3-107(b). When construing a series of terms such as the ones in section 3-107(b), we are guided by the commonsense principle \"that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\" Third National Bank in Nashville v. Impac Ltd. , 432 U.S. 312, 322, 97 S.Ct. 2307, 53 L.Ed.2d 368 (1977). This principle is related to the canon of statutory construction known as noscitur a sociis , i.e. , \" 'a word is known by the company it keeps.' \" People v. Gaytan , 2015 IL 116223, ¶ 30, 392 Ill.Dec. 333, 32 N.E.3d 641 (quoting Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co. , 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961) ). In other words, \"a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\" United States v. Williams , 553 U.S. 285, 294, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008).\n¶ 32 The canon of noscitur a sociis is particularly useful when construing one term in a list, in order \"to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving 'unintended breadth to [legislative acts].' \" Gustafson v. Alloyd Co. , 513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995) (quoting Jarecki , 367 U.S. at 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579 ). For example, in Gustafson , the United States Supreme Court \"interpreted the word 'communication' in § 2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 [ (48 Stat. 74 (1933) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(10) )) ] to refer to a public communication, rather than any communication, because the word appeared in a list with other words, notably 'notice, circular, [and] advertisement,' making it 'apparent that the list refer[red] to documents of wide dissemination.' \" Yates v. United States , 574 U.S. ----, ----, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1085, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015) (quoting Gustafson , 513 U.S. at 575-76, 115 S.Ct. 1061 ). \"And [the Court] did so even though the list began with the word 'any.' \" Id. at ----, 135 S.Ct. at 1085.\n¶ 33 Utilizing these principles of statutory interpretation, we reject the City's argument that the Skokie Valley Bike Path is obviously a \"trail\" as that word is ordinarily and popularly used. According to the City, the numerous references in the record describing the path as a \"trail\" are compelling evidence that the path is a \"riding trail\" as set forth in section 3-107(b). The City engages in the same flawed analysis as the appellate court, however, removing the word \"trail\" from the context of the statute and assigning to it a broad, general definition. Reading the text as a whole, we find that the words \"hiking,\" \"fishing,\" and \"hunting\" dictate a narrower construction of the term \"trail.\" If section 3-107(b) stated that immunity applied to \"any jogging, riding, in-line skating, or stroller trail,\" then it would be easy to find that a shared-use path such as the Skokie Valley Bike Path is a \"riding trail.\" However, the inclusion of the words \"hiking,\" \"fishing,\" and \"hunting\" in the same sentence as \"riding\" indicates that the legislature intended to apply blanket immunity only to primitive, rustic, or unimproved trails. The word \"hunting,\" in particular, leads us to this conclusion. A trail that leads to a deer blind or other hunting spot will likely be minimal, to avoid disturbing the game. There is no reasonable way that a hunting trail can be associated with or given a related meaning to the type of shared-use path at issue here.\n¶ 34 Further support for our interpretation of the statutory language in section 3-107(b) is found when we compare it with the language in section 3-107(a). Under the doctrine of in pari materia , two sections of the same statute \"will be considered with reference to each other, 'so that they may be given harmonious effect.' \" Collinsville Community Unit School District No. 10 v. Regional Board of School Trustees , 218 Ill. 2d 175, 185, 300 Ill.Dec. 15, 843 N.E.2d 273 (2006) (quoting Land v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago , 202 Ill. 2d 414, 422, 269 Ill.Dec. 452, 781 N.E.2d 249 (2002) ). Section 3-107(a) grants immunity from liability for an injury caused by a condition of: \"(a) Any road which provides access to fishing, hunting, or primitive camping, recreational, or scenic areas and which is not a (1) city, town or village street, (2) county, state or federal highway or (3) a township or other road district highway.\" 745 ILCS 10/3-107(a) (West 2012). The reference in section 3-107(a) to roads that provide access to \"primitive\" areas, rather than official streets, suggests that the legislature intended section 3-107 of the Act to apply to primitive, unfinished trails and roads. See Goodwin v. Carbondale Park District , 268 Ill. App. 3d 489, 493, 205 Ill.Dec. 956, 644 N.E.2d 512 (1994) (\"Reading section 3-107 as a whole indicates that the property referred to therein is unimproved property which is not maintained by the local governmental body and which is in its natural condition with obvious hazards as a result of that natural condition.\").\n¶ 35 In addition, the City's interpretation of the statute leads to anomalous results when applied to a bicycle path located in a recreational area such as a public park. In construing statutory language, we may consider the consequences that would result in interpreting the statute one way or the other. County of Du Page v. Illinois Labor Relations Board , 231 Ill. 2d 593, 604, 326 Ill.Dec. 848, 900 N.E.2d 1095 (2008). We also presume that the legislature did not intend absurdity, inconvenience, or injustice. Brucker v. Mercola , 227 Ill. 2d 502, 514, 319 Ill.Dec. 543, 886 N.E.2d 306 (2007). Many shared-use paths run through public parks and other recreational areas. Under section 3-106 of the Act, injuries occurring due to a condition of recreational land are subject to immunity only for negligent conduct and not for willful and wanton conduct. See Moore v. Chicago Park District , 2012 IL 112788, ¶ 10, 365 Ill.Dec. 547, 978 N.E.2d 1050. Section 3-106 of the Act provides:\n\"Neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury where the liability is based on the existence of a condition of any public property intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes, including but not limited to parks, playgrounds, open areas, buildings or other enclosed recreational facilities, unless such local entity or public employee is guilty of willful and wanton conduct proximately causing such injury.\" 745 ILCS 10/3-106 (West 2012).\nIf a bicycle path winding through a public park were subject to blanket immunity under section 3-107(b), a pedestrian would be barred from suing for an injury caused by a condition of the path, while being able to sue for the exact same injury occurring on park grounds next to the path. This inconsistent treatment can be avoided, however, by construing the Act so that a shared-use trail in a public park or recreational area is subject to section 3-106 of the Act rather than section 3-107(b).\n¶ 36 The City also contends that construing the statute broadly to grant blanket immunity for all bicycle paths would promote the public policy underlying the statute. According to the City, the public policy behind section 3-107(b) is to promote the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of creating greater access to riding trails, rather than to divert those funds to pay damage claims stemming from the condition of those trails. Cf. Moore , 2012 IL 112788, ¶ 22, 365 Ill.Dec. 547, 978 N.E.2d 1050 (discussing the public policy rationale for section 3-106 of the Act). But public policy also points the other way. After all, it seems strange to say that a local public entity can build and maintain a bike trail, encourage people to use it, and represent that it is safe but then escape all liability for injuries caused by even the most egregious misconduct in failing to maintain it.\n¶ 37 At the same time, it makes sense to apply blanket immunity to undeveloped, unimproved trails that are left in their natural state as a feature of those trails. Requiring public entities to maintain such trails \"would defeat the very purpose of these types of recreational areas, that is, the enjoyment of activities in a truly natural setting.\" Goodwin , 268 Ill. App. 3d at 493, 205 Ill.Dec. 956, 644 N.E.2d 512. A law review article published shortly after section 3-107 was enacted makes a similar point:\n\"There is at least one situation in which it may be undesirable to require a public entity to maintain its land in safe condition, and that is as to those lands set aside for hiking, camping, fishing, and hunting. The users of these lands desire to have the property maintained in its natural condition. To maintain this land in a reasonably safe condition would, to some degree, defeat the purpose for which such lands have been provided.\" Comment, Illinois Tort Claims Act: A New Approach to Municipal Tort Immunity in Illinois , 61 Nw. U. L. Rev. 265, 287 n.102 (1966).\nBecause there are legitimate policy reasons for giving the statute a narrow application, the policy reasons offered by the City cannot overcome the language of the statute. Furthermore, the Act is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed against the governmental entity claiming immunity. Van Meter v. Darien Park District , 207 Ill. 2d 359, 368, 278 Ill.Dec. 555, 799 N.E.2d 273 (2003).\n¶ 38 The City makes an additional argument that the definition of a \"recreational trail\" in section 10 of the Recreational Trails of Illinois Act ( 20 ILCS 862/10 (West 2012) ) should be read into section 3-107(b) of the Tort Immunity Act. Id. (defining a \"recreational trail,\" in part, as \"a thoroughfare or track across land or snow\"). We reject this argument. The two statutes have different purposes and different contexts, and it is inappropriate to import the definition of the term \"trail\" from one statute to another, since \"the context in which a term is used obviously bears upon its intended meaning.\" People ex rel. Illinois Department of Labor v. E.R.H. Enterprises, Inc. , 2013 IL 115106, ¶ 29, 378 Ill.Dec. 402, 4 N.E.3d 1.\n¶ 39 Accordingly, we hold that section 3-107(b) of the Act was intended to apply only to primitive or rustic trails.\nThese include any designated hiking, riding, fishing, or hunting trail that retains its original, natural surface and is not improved with asphalt, concrete, crushed aggregate, or similar finishes and is not intended for ordinary \"on-road\" type bicycles, bicyclists pulling children in trailers, pedestrians pushing strollers, or similar forms of transportation. The Skokie Valley Bike Path is a 10-mile-long, shared-use path, paved with asphalt and held out for the use of bicycles, pedestrians, and in-line skaters. It is not a \"trail\" within the meaning of the statute as this court has interpreted the term. Thus, section 3-107(b) does not apply in this case, and summary judgment for the City was improper.\n¶ 40 As a final matter, in light of our holding that immunity under section 3-107(b) is inapplicable to the allegations in plaintiff's complaint, we need not address plaintiff's alternative argument that the City waived its tort immunity defense through its maintenance agreement with the County.\n¶ 41 CONCLUSION\n¶ 42 For the foregoing reasons, we find that the circuit court's order entering summary judgment in favor of the City was in error. We thus affirm the appellate court's judgment. The matter is remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n¶ 43 Appellate court judgment affirmed.\n¶ 44 Circuit court judgment reversed.\n¶ 45 Cause remanded.\nChief Justice Karmeier and Justices Freeman, Thomas, Kilbride, Garman, and Theis concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nPortions of the record refer to the path as the \"Old Skokie Bike Path\" or the \"Skokie Valley Bikeway.\"\nLake County's motion was uncontested, was not appealed, and is not at issue in these proceedings. The County is not a party to the appeal before this court.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE O'BRIEN delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 Petitioner Fanny Lewin, n/k/a Levitt, filed a motion to enforce or clarify the marital settlement agreement she entered with respondent Pierre Lewin, which was incorporated in the judgment of dissolution of their marriage. Pierre moved to dismiss, which the trial court granted. Fanny appealed. We affirm.\n¶ 2 FACTS\n¶ 3 Petitioner Fanny Lewin, n/k/a Levitt, and respondent Pierre Lewin were married in July 1997 in Las Vegas, Nevada. They permanently moved to the United States from France in 1998, so Pierre could pursue business opportunities. In 2000 and again in 2004, Pierre was terminated from his employment and the couple faced having to move back to France. In the summer of 2004, a French business colleague, Patrick Peronnet, suggested he and Pierre start a business in Illinois. One condition for the partnership was that Pierre and Fanny execute a postmarital agreement. Patrick sought the agreement because he did not want Fanny involved in the business or to become his business partner. Pierre and Fanny believed the postmarital agreement would protect Fanny and the couple's children from creditors should the new business venture fail. In March 2005, the parties signed a postmarital agreement. The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that Fanny would receive the marital home, her vehicle and the savings account in exchange for waiving maintenance. Pierre would receive the business interests. At the time the agreement was signed, neither Fanny nor Pierre anticipated a divorce.\n¶ 4 In May 2014, Fanny filed for dissolution of the marriage. The parties executed a marital settlement agreement (MSA), which provides, in pertinent part:\n\"11. Respondent shall be allowed to claim for Federal and State Income Tax purposes for 2016 all allowable deductions related to the properties on Brookforest and St. Charles, including the real estate taxes and deducible interest.\n* * *\n17. Petitioner shall have as and for her own, free and clear of any claim of Respondent the former marital residence at 3100 S. St. Charles Place, Peoria, Illinois and the residence at 908 W. Brookforest, Peoria, Illinois, free and clear of any claim of Respondent. Petitioner shall be responsible for payment of 50% of the line of credit obtained to pay attorney fees in these proceedings. The $50,000 shall be deducted from the $2,000,000.00 settlement resulting in the $1,950,000.00 settlement. Respondent shall be responsible for payment of the entire $100,000.00 line of credit and shall hold Petitioner harmless therefrom.\nRespondent shall have the right to live in and occupy the Brookforest residence until such time as he advises the Petitioner that he will move to another location or until Petitioner decides to sell the residence at which time she shall provide him with written notice and allow him 90 days to move from the residence.\nIn the event Respondent decides to move from the Brookforest residence, he shall provide Petitioner with his Notice of Intent to Move no less than 30 days before the move.\nRespondent shall be responsible for payment of all utilities during his period of occupancy of the Brookforest residence. In all other respects, Petitioner shall be responsible for all expenses, debts and obligations arising out of ownership of both properties, including the second installment of the 2015 real estate taxes payable in 2016 and all subsequent years of real estate taxes, home owner's insurance, together with cost of sale, including any closing costs and realtor's commissions.\"\n¶ 5 A judgment of dissolution was entered on August 19, 2016, which incorporated the MSA. The judgment of dissolution included an express integration clause. In November 2016, Fanny filed a motion to enforce or clarify the MSA, arguing that it did not assign the mortgage payments to her and that it was her understanding Pierre would remain responsible for paying the mortgage because he had always made the payments. Fanny requested the court determine that Pierre was responsible for the mortgage on the St. Charles Place residence and require him to reimburse her for mortgage payments she had made and to hold her harmless.\n¶ 6 Pierre moved to dismiss pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Civil Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2016) ), alleging Fanny's motion was untimely and failed to state a cause of action. The motion was granted in part and denied in part. The trial court found Fanny's motion requested the clarification or interpretation, not the modification, of the MSA, and rejected Pierre's untimeliness argument. The trial court reviewed the agreement, concluded the MSA was not ambiguous, and refused to apply the provisional admission approach to interpret the agreement. The court granted dismissal under section 2-619(a)(9) ( 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2016) ) of the Civil Code. Fanny timely appealed.\n¶ 7 ANALYSIS\n¶ 8 Fanny presents several arguments that dismissal was improper, including the trial court erred in converting Pierre's section 2-615 motion to dismiss into a section 2-619 motion to dismiss, failed to apply the provisional admission approach to interpret the MSA, did not consider the incompleteness and mistake exceptions to the parol evidence rule, and improperly found the MSA was unambiguous.\n¶ 9 A section 2-615 motion to dismiss alleges the complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2016). The motion presents the question of whether the complaint's allegations, taken as true and viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmovant, are sufficient to state a cause of action on which relief may be granted. Turner v. Memorial Medical Center , 233 Ill. 2d 494, 499, 331 Ill.Dec. 548, 911 N.E.2d 369 (2009). A section 2-619(a)(9) motion accepts the legal sufficiency of the complaint but alleges that plaintiff's claim is barred by other affirmative matter that avoids or defeats the claim. 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2016). \"An 'affirmative matter' is something in the nature of a defense that negates the cause of action completely.\" Martinez v. Cook County Sheriff's Office , 2017 IL App (3d) 160514, ¶ 15, 418 Ill.Dec. 161, 89 N.E.3d 995. Our review of a dismissal under either section 2-615 or section 2-619 is de novo. Morrow v. Pappas , 2017 IL App (3d) 160393, ¶ 42, 418 Ill.Dec. 343, 90 N.E.3d 501 (section 2-615) ; In re Marriage of Morreale , 351 Ill. App. 3d 238, 240, 286 Ill.Dec. 256, 813 N.E.2d 313 (2004) ( section 2-619 ).\n¶ 10 As a first matter, we address Fanny's argument that the trial court improperly converted Pierre's section 2-615 motion to dismiss to a section 2-619 motion, precluding her from presenting evidence in support of her motion to enforce or clarify. She submits the trial court's conversion shifted the focus on Pierre's motion to dismiss from a legal inquiry to a fact-based dispute and argument on the merits. According to Fanny, she was never given an opportunity to submit any evidence to show an ambiguity exists in the MSA, which prejudiced her and resulted in the improper dismissal of her motion to enforce or clarify.\n¶ 11 The mislabeling of a motion to dismiss is not always fatal and the court will consider the motion where no prejudice resulted from the improper designation. Wallace v. Smyth , 203 Ill. 2d 441, 447, 272 Ill.Dec. 146, 786 N.E.2d 980 (2002). However, where the mislabeling prejudices the nonmoving party, the court's grant of the dismissal must be reversed. Premier Electrical Construction Co. v. La Salle National Bank , 115 Ill. App. 3d 638, 642, 71 Ill.Dec. 481, 450 N.E.2d 1360 (1983).\n¶ 12 When ruling on a section 2-615 motion to dismiss, a court may not consider affidavits, the results of discovery, or other documentary evidence that was not included with the pleadings as exhibits or other supporting evidence. Hartmann Realtors v. Biffar , 2014 IL App (5th) 130543, ¶ 14, 382 Ill.Dec. 937, 13 N.E.3d 350. The court may not consider evidence outside the pleading when ruling on the motion. Gilmore v. Stanmar, Inc. , 261 Ill. App. 3d 651, 654, 199 Ill.Dec. 189, 633 N.E.2d 985 (1994). In contrast, a section 2-619 motion asserts defects or defenses outside the pleadings that defeat the claims. Solaia Technology, LLC v. Specialty Publishing Co. , 221 Ill. 2d 558, 579, 304 Ill.Dec. 369, 852 N.E.2d 825 (2006). The court must determine whether the supporting materials establish an affirmative matter defeating the petitioner's claim. Turner v. 1212 S. Michigan Partnership , 355 Ill. App. 3d 885, 892, 291 Ill.Dec. 476, 823 N.E.2d 1062 (2005) (citing Waterford Executive Group, Ltd. v. Clark/Bardes, Inc. , 261 Ill. App. 3d 338, 343, 199 Ill.Dec. 207, 633 N.E.2d 1003 (1994) ). In a ruling on a section 2-615 motion to dismiss, a court may not rely on facts outside the complaint. Visvardis v. Eric P. Ferleger, P.C. , 375 Ill. App. 3d 719, 724, 313 Ill.Dec. 812, 873 N.E.2d 436 (2007).\n¶ 13 An integration clause is designed to bind the parties to the terms of their written agreement. Air Safety, Inc. v. Teachers Realty Corp. , 185 Ill. 2d 457, 464, 236 Ill.Dec. 8, 706 N.E.2d 882 (1999) (citing Armstrong Paint & Varnish Works v. Continental Can Co. , 301 Ill. 102, 106, 133 N.E. 711 (1921) ). By using an integration clause in a contract, the parties are \"explicitly manifesting their intention to protect themselves against misinterpretations which might arise from extrinsic evidence.\" Air Safety , 185 Ill. 2d at 464, 236 Ill.Dec. 8, 706 N.E.2d 882. Where an integration clause is included in an agreement, the four corners rule applies and extrinsic evidence is not admissible to interpret the agreement.\nEichengreen v. Rollins, Inc. , 325 Ill. App. 3d 517, 522, 259 Ill.Dec. 89, 757 N.E.2d 952 (2001). In contrast, the provisional admissibility approach allows the use of extrinsic evidence to aid in interpreting an agreement that is otherwise unambiguous on its face. Ahsan v. Eagle, Inc. , 287 Ill. App. 3d 788, 790, 223 Ill.Dec. 107, 678 N.E.2d 1238 (1997). Under that approach, the court first provisionally examines the extrinsic evidence to determine whether there is an ambiguity. Id. The provisional admission approach does not apply to contracts with an integration clause. Air Safety , 185 Ill. 2d at 464, 236 Ill.Dec. 8, 706 N.E.2d 882.\n¶ 14 Pierre argues that the provisional admission approach is not applicable because the parties' MSA was an integrated statement of settlement of the parties' dissolution issues. The judgment of dissolution, which incorporated the MSA and included an express integration clause, was attached to Pierre's motion to dismiss. The judgment provides that the MSA settles \"all questions of property rights, claims against each other, rights of maintenance and all other marital rights arising out of their marriage to each other.\" The MSA was a fully integrated agreement and intended to be the entire agreement between the parties. Insertion of the integrated clause in the dissolution judgment reflects Fanny and Pierre's intent to bind themselves to their written agreement. The integration clause precluded the use of the provisional admissibility approach and extrinsic evidence was not admissible to support Fanny's claim that the MSA was ambiguous regarding the mortgage payment. Because Fanny could not present any extrinsic evidence to support her interpretation of the MSA, she could not have been prejudiced by the trial court's treatment of the section 2-615 motion as a section 2-619(a)(9) motion. We find the trial court did not err when it granted Pierre's motion to dismiss.\n¶ 15 CONCLUSION\n¶ 16 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed.\n¶ 17 Affirmed.\nPresiding Justice Carter and Justice Holdridge concurred in the judgment and opinion.",

                            "text": "JUSTICE BURKE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 Petitioner Uliana Kranzler appeals the circuit court's orders granting respondent Leonard Kranzler's motion for declaratory judgment and denying her motion to dismiss. We affirm, based on our conclusions that the circuit court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the dispute and the parties' premarital agreement was valid and enforceable.\n¶ 2 I. BACKGROUND\n¶ 3 On October 9, 1984, Uliana and Leonard married on the same day they executed the premarital agreement. At the time, Leonard was 47 years old and Uliana was 29 years old and approximately five months pregnant with the couple's first child. The parties ultimately had three children, all of whom were emancipated adults at the time Uliana filed her petition for dissolution in 2015.\n¶ 4 The agreement provides, inter alia , that (1) any property acquired before marriage would remain in their individual names upon termination of the marriage and each party waived any interest in or claim to the other's property or income; (2) any property acquired jointly during the marriage would be divided equally upon termination of the marriage or death; (3) provided they were married at the time of death, Leonard would leave to Uliana a certain percentage of his net estate, which increased the longer they were married (40% if the parties were married more than 180 months); and (4) if either party filed for dissolution or separation, Leonard agreed to pay to Uliana, in lieu of maintenance, a set monthly amount for a certain number of months, both of which increased the longer they were married. As the parties were married for more than 240 months, Uliana was entitled to receive $2500 per month 3 for 100 months. Attached to the agreement was a document disclosing Leonard's financial condition and assets, which were approximately $6.9 million in 1984.\n¶ 5 On October 8, 2015, Uliana filed a petition for dissolution of marriage (case No. 15-D9295). Leonard filed an answer on November 19, 2015, raising no counterclaims.\n¶ 6 On December 10, 2015, Leonard filed a motion for a declaratory judgment under section 2-701 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/2-701 (West 2014) ), requesting that the circuit court find the premarital agreement valid and enforceable.\n¶ 7 Uliana filed a response and an amended response on July 14, 2016, to Leonard's motion for declaratory relief. She also filed a countermotion for declaratory judgment regarding the agreement. Uliana argued that the agreement was invalid on grounds that it was unfair and unreasonable; created an unforeseeable condition of penury, was void due to duress, lack of knowledge, and undue influence; was unconscionable; and was based on an illusory promise.\n¶ 8 On November 14, 2016, Uliana filed a motion for voluntary dismissal of her dissolution action. On November 15, 2016, Leonard filed a counterpetition for dissolution of marriage and a motion for leave to file the counterpetition. On November 16, 2016, Leonard filed a response to Uliana's motion for voluntary dismissal of her petition, asserting that his motion for declaratory relief could stand as an independent cause of action surviving the dismissal.\n¶ 9 On November 17, 2016, the circuit court granted Uliana's motion for voluntary dismissal of her petition for dissolution, but found that, based on In re Marriage of Best , 228 Ill. 2d 107, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939 (2008), and In re Marriage of Krol , 2015 IL App (1st) 140976, 390 Ill.Dec. 501, 29 N.E.3d 433, Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment constituted an independent action surviving dismissal of her petition. On November 18, 2016, the court denied Leonard's motion for leave to file a counterpetition for dissolution of marriage.\n¶ 10 On November 18, 2016, Leonard initiated a separate dissolution action by filing his own petition for dissolution of marriage, which proceeded before the same judge (case No. 16-D10698). He filed a motion to consolidate the two cases but later withdrew it. Uliana filed an answer and counterclaim, asserting, inter alia , the same arguments she had raised against the agreement in response to Leonard's motion for declaratory relief. Leonard moved to dismiss Uliana's counterclaims in his dissolution case.\n¶ 11 On November 29, 2016, Uliana filed a motion to dismiss Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment in the present case on the basis of (1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and (2) failure to satisfy the termination-of-controversy required for declaratory relief.\n¶ 12 The circuit court denied Uliana's motion to dismiss Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment on January 3, 2017, citing the same reasons it relied on in allowing Leonard's motion for a declaratory judgment to survive the dismissal of Uliana's petition for dissolution. The court also denied Uliana's request for a finding that there was no just reason for delaying appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). In addition, the circuit court entered an order in Leonard's dissolution case (case No. 16-D-10698), granting Leonard's motion to dismiss most of Uliana's counterclaims.\n¶ 13 A trial on Leonard's motion for declaratory relief (in case No. 15-D-9295) occurred over two days. Leonard testified that he and Uliana began dating in August 1983 but continued to date other people.\nWithin a few months of meeting, Uliana moved into his apartment. At some point, Uliana became pregnant; she had an abortion after they discussed it. Approximately one year later, Uliana again became pregnant. Uliana told Leonard that she did not want to have another abortion. Leonard responded that he understood, but he did not want to get married. Leonard testified that neither he nor Uliana wanted to get married.\n¶ 14 Leonard testified that when his father and Uliana's father learned of the second pregnancy, they spoke to each other and then to Leonard about marrying Uliana. \"[T]he discussion was get married, have an antenuptial agreement that allows you to have a short marriage if that is what you wish, this covers all the bases, the baby will not be born improperly, you will go on with your lives without great cost emotionally and socially.\" Leonard testified that the two fathers reasoned that the marriage could be short and \"[t]he prenup will protect you from serious financial consequences. If you choose to stay married longer, you can do so. * * * And that seemed like a reasonable compromise so that since there will be no abortion, the baby will have a name and be a legitimate baby not born out of wedlock.\"\n¶ 15 Leonard testified that he was persuaded to get married because having a baby out of wedlock would \"affect the child, it would affect my professional standing, reputation, and Uli[ana]'s reputation.\" Leonard testified that he was concerned with the embarrassment it would bring to him and his family. He also decided to get married out of respect for his father, although his father would not have disowned or disinherited him. Leonard testified that Uliana's father was similarly eager for her to marry because of the concern of bringing shame to her and her family. Leonard testified that \"to a large extent\" both he and Uliana were forced to get married.\n¶ 16 Leonard believed his father, who was an attorney, contacted a law firm to draft the agreement. Leonard believed Uliana's lawyer was sent a draft of the agreement on September 27, 1984. Leonard testified that \"various versions of the prenup were presented back and forth\" and there were negotiations and revisions by Uliana and her lawyer.\n¶ 17 With regard to the execution of the agreement, Leonard testified that \"[t]he understanding was that if she would sign the agreement, I would sign the agreement. And apparently some many days or weeks went by where she was not signing, I was not signing.\" On the evening of October 9, 1984, his father called him and informed him that Uliana had agreed to sign the agreement. Leonard \"said, well, I had agreed to sign it if she did also. So I left what I was doing and went to the apartment, and the rest followed.\"\n¶ 18 When he arrived at his apartment, his father, Uliana's father, Uliana, a rabbi, and a mutual friend were already there. He believed Uliana signed the document around 7, 8, or 9 p.m. that evening. Leonard testified that they did not discuss anything but sat down at the dining room table and signed the agreement. Uliana initialed each page and signed it. He did not force her to sign it. Uliana was five months pregnant at the time. She was experiencing a difficult pregnancy as \"she was nauseated, retching, and she had to eat continuously,\" but he did not notice these symptoms that evening. Leonard described Uliana's demeanor at the time as \"normal\" and \"composed\"; she did not appear to be upset. A list of Leonard's assets, liabilities, and income was attached to the agreement. Leonard made one alteration when he signed the agreement, which was to extend the time period Uliana would receive alimony from 24 months to 36 months if they were married for less than 24 months. The wedding ceremony occurred immediately afterwards on the balcony of their apartment.\n¶ 19 Leonard testified that he and Uliana lived together for a year or a year and a half before they married. They did not have a formal financial arrangement; she asked him for money whenever she needed it. They lived in a 3500 square foot apartment on Lake Shore Drive which cost approximately $3500 per month. Leonard was a physician at the time and he obtained a law degree during the marriage. Uliana worked in a real estate office as either the office manager or a \"high-level secretary.\" She stopped working shortly after they married.\n¶ 20 Leonard conceded that after Uliana filed the petition for dissolution, he created an estate plan that was not in conformance with the agreement. He subsequently modified it to conform to the agreement. She also had a life insurance policy for him.\n¶ 21 Uliana testified that she is originally from Europe and came to the United States in 1972. She attended the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, graduating in 1979 with a degree in communications, speech, and theater, and a minor in Biology. She worked throughout high school and college and paid for her education. She has previously worked as a babysitter, instructor at a health club, manager of a health club, and in a real estate office. Uliana survived cervical cancer when she was 24 years old.\n¶ 22 She testified that she became pregnant in 1982. When her mother, who was a \"Ph.D. nurse,\" realized Uliana was pregnant, her mother disowned her, so she moved in with Leonard. She got an abortion. At the time, she was 26 years old and Leonard was 44 years old.\n¶ 23 Uliana became pregnant again in 1984. Uliana testified that she and Leonard did not really discuss marriage. Uliana testified Leonard \"was not unhappy or happy. But he didn't promote the marriage. And I stated to him I will not have another abortion. I would have a child, and I don't need to be married. I will not-I am not looking for marriage, but I will not kill another baby.\" She testified that she did not want to get married because she felt that Leonard wanted her to have another abortion; he did not push marriage but instead avoided the situation and her by coming home late from work.\n¶ 24 Uliana testified that she could not support herself at the time. She was \"running the front desk\" of a real estate office and earned \"a couple hundred dollars\" per week. She was also making payments on her own car. She worked full time until January 1985, approximately one and a half months before she gave birth. She testified that she experienced a \"toxic pregnancy\"; she was \"throwing up day and night,\" ate bread or bagels constantly, and had to take a two-hour lunch at work in order to take a nap due to fatigue. She experienced edema in her feet and became \"tremendously overweight.\"\n¶ 25 Uliana did not tell her father about the pregnancy until she was over four months along because she knew she would \"break his heart\" since he was \"old fashioned.\" Her father asked about marriage, but she informed him that she and Leonard did not want to get married. Her father refused to speak to her for one month after that. Her father stated that he would \"disown me to have a bastard of a child.\" Uliana testified that Leonard's father spoke with her father and they then told Uliana \"you need to get married because you don't want to have a bastard for a child.\" They called her every day. She testified that she trusted Leonard's father \"[f]or his advice and for his tremendous care of me, calling me, asking me how I feel * * * on a daily basis.\"\n¶ 26 Uliana testified that when she was four and a half months pregnant, Leonard presented her with \"a prenup\" and told her \"the only way we could get married is if you sign this prenup.\" Uliana testified that Leonard gave her the draft agreement in September and stated \"this is a prenup. If you want to sign this, I guess we will get married.\"\n¶ 27 She read the agreement, but could not understand it. She called Leonard's father because he was \"[a] lawyer and I trusted him * * * to guide me on the prenup, to say-I didn't understand. I have never heard of prenups.\" He told Uliana to look for an attorney. Through a colleague, she found a lawyer to examine it. She met with him once to review the agreement.\n¶ 28 Approximately one week after Leonard presented her with the agreement, Uliana informed him that she did not want to sign it. She testified that Leonard \"didn't say anything. I said I am not signing it and I am not going through this. I don't need to marry you. I am going to have a child. I am happy to have a child and to raise a child.\"\n¶ 29 Uliana testified that she did not want to marry Leonard. However, she ultimately married him anyway because \"[b]eing called daily and being told by two separate people that were fathers, his father, my father saying you can't have a child that is a bastard. You cannot do that. Think of your child. The child needs a name. And, of course, I was sicker and sicker, gaining more weight. Had edema, swelling feet, couldn't walk.\" She was hospitalized three or four times for dehydration during her pregnancy.\n¶ 30 Uliana testified that on October 9, 1984, she came home from work at 6 p.m. and Leonard arrived at 9 p.m. and told her \"we get married tonight or never\" and \"here is the prenup. And if you don't sign it, we will not get married anymore. That's it. This is the last chance.\" Leonard informed her that his parents were coming over for the Jewish holiday, Sukkot, and \"[w]e get married today or never, and you got to sign this. Without this, we don't get married.\" Uliana testified that it took her 20 to 30 minutes to sign it. None of her friends or family were present; her father was at work and her brother lived in Wisconsin. She initialed every page but did not read it. She did not make any changes to it. She then signed the ketubah and the ceremony was held \"[a] few minutes before midnight.\" Leonard's father and mother, Leonard's sister and her husband, the rabbi, and their mutual friend and his wife were present. Uliana testified that she was five months pregnant at the time; she felt fatigued and tired and \"couldn't even keep my head up.\" She testified that she threw up in the bathroom a few times and then went out onto the balcony, where the ceremony occurred. She testified that she leaned against a post during the ceremony because her feet were so swollen.\n¶ 31 Uliana testified that she had last seen the agreement in September when she reviewed it with her lawyer, but she did not understand what she would receive in the event of divorce or what she was giving up. She had a copy of it at home. She testified that she was not aware of the value of Leonard's estate before she married him, although she was presented with the exhibit attached to the agreement when she met with her lawyer.\n¶ 32 She testified that Leonard supported her financially during the marriage and she did not have other assets. He gives her a $1000 a month \"allowance\" for food and clothing and covers her travel expenses separately. She owns a house in Michigan jointly with her three children that she estimates is worth $200,000. She also owns five cemetery plots. Uliana testified that she currently manages four residential real estate rental properties that Leonard owns. She lives in the couple's 5500 square foot home. The property they lived in before that was also a 5500 square foot custom-built home. They also have a 3600 square foot penthouse in Florida. She drove Lexus vehicles for most of their marriage. They vacationed in Florida every year, traveled internationally, and attended the opera, symphony, and theater.\n¶ 33 She testified that $2500 per month would not cover her current medical bills. Regarding her current health status and medical expenses, Uliana testified that she had abnormal tissue removed from her breast in 2009 and suffered an infection when her implant was removed. She is also diabetic and suffers from high blood pressure, depression, and severe osteoporosis, which requires a $1600 shot twice a year to treat. She suffers from complications as a result of bariatric surgery in 2006. She needs a hip replacement but cannot afford it. She is in chronic pain and is qualified to receive a morphine pump.\n¶ 34 On May 1, 2017, the circuit court entered an order in which it found that the agreement was valid and enforceable and granted Leonard's motion for declaratory relief. The circuit court's order provided:\n\"A. When petitioner and respondent signed the Antenuptial Agreement it was fair and reasonable.\nB. Uliana Kranzler did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the Antenuptial Agreement was the product of fraud, duress, or coercion.\nC. Neither party particularly wanted to get married.\nD. Uliana Kranzler although she did not read the Antenuptial Agreement on the day she signed it, she was represented by counsel and had the opportunity to be advised on the Antenuptial Agreement and the time to read and understand the agreement.\nE. The parties may have contemplated a short marriage and the court observes that the Premaritial Agreement Act, enacted after the parties' marriage, the court believes redefines penury differently than prior case law.\nF. If there was any coercion on the parties, who * * * married for religious/ cultural reasons, it came from their parents, but that does not amount to the coercion or duress contemplated by the case law.\nG. The court finds that the award of scheduled payments are sufficient in the circumstances may have been on the low side of fair and reasonable but even so especially when coupled with the award of a portion of Leonard Kranzler's estate, given the age differences between the parties, that the Antenuptial Agreement is fair and reasonable.\nH. Uliana Kranzler entered into the Antenuptial Agreement voluntarily.\nI. The Antenuptial Agreement in the event of Leonard's death did not differentiate between his separate estate and his entire estate.\"\n¶ 35 The trial court included a Rule 304(a) finding. Uliana filed a timely notice of appeal from the May 1, 2017, order.\n¶ 36 II. ANALYSIS\n¶ 37 A. Standard of Review\n¶ 38 A motion to dismiss brought pursuant to section 2-619(a)(1) of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2619(a)(1) (West 2014) ) permits involuntary dismissal of an action based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We review de novo the trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion under this section. R.L. Vollintine Construction, Inc. v. Illinois Capital Development Board , 2014 IL App (4th) 130824, ¶ 23, 385 Ill.Dec. 809, 19 N.E.3d 741. In doing so, we must interpret the pleadings and any supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\n¶ 39 The appropriate standard of review to be applied to declaratory judgments depends on the underlying questions at issue and \"the nature of the proceedings in the trial court.\" Pekin Insurance Co. v.

Uliana's Motion to Dismiss Leonard's Motion for Declaratory Judgment\n¶ 41 On appeal, Uliana first contends that the circuit court erred in denying her motion to dismiss Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment because the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Leonard's motion after she voluntarily dismissed her petition for dissolution.\n¶ 42 Leonard responds that his request for declaratory relief was based on distinct statutory grounds from Uliana's petition for dissolution of marriage and constituted an independent controversy which could stand on its own.\n¶ 43 Circuit courts of our State possess original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters brought before it. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, § 9 ; In re Luis R. , 239 Ill. 2d 295, 301, 346 Ill.Dec. 578, 941 N.E.2d 136 (2010). \"This court defines subject-matter jurisdiction as a court's power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceeding in question belongs.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Luis R. , 239 Ill. 2d at 300, 346 Ill.Dec. 578, 941 N.E.2d 136. To invoke the circuit court's subject-matter jurisdiction, the complaint or petition must allege the existence of justiciable matter. Id. at 300-01, 346 Ill.Dec. 578, 941 N.E.2d 136. \"Generally speaking, a 'justiciable matter' is 'a controversy appropriate for review by the court, in that it is definite and concrete, as opposed to hypothetical or moot, touching upon the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.' \" Id. at 301, 346 Ill.Dec. 578, 941 N.E.2d 136 (quoting Belleville Toyota, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. , 199 Ill. 2d 325, 335, 264 Ill.Dec. 283, 770 N.E.2d 177 (2002) ). \"In other words, the only consideration is whether the alleged claim falls within the general class of cases that the court has the inherent power to hear and determine.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Id.\n¶ 44 The parties do not dispute that the circuit court had subject-matter jurisdiction over Uliana's petition for dissolution of marriage, which she brought under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Marriage Act) ( 750 ILCS 5/101 et seq. (West 2014) ). Such jurisdiction is statutorily conferred. In re Marriage of Milliken , 199 Ill. App. 3d 813, 817, 145 Ill.Dec. 821, 557 N.E.2d 591 (1990) (\"The jurisdiction of a court in a dissolution proceeding is limited to that conferred by statute.\").\n¶ 45 Leonard filed his motion for declaratory relief under section 2-701 of the Code. Subsection (a) of this statute provides that a court\n\"may, in cases of actual controversy, make binding declarations of rights, having the force of final judgments, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed, including the determination, at the instance of anyone interested in the controversy, of the construction of any * * * contract or other written instrument, and a declaration of the rights of the parties interested. * * * The court shall refuse to enter a declaratory judgment or order, if it appears that the judgment or order, would not terminate the controversy or some part thereof, giving rise to the proceeding.\" 735 ILCS 5/2-701(a) (West 2014).\n¶ 46 Under subsection 2-701(b), a \"[d]eclarations of rights, as herein provided for, may be obtained by means of a pleading seeking that relief alone, or as incident to or part of a complaint, counterclaim or other pleading seeking other relief as well.\" Id. § 2-701(b).\nÂ¶ 47 Uliana argues that the validity of the agreement was merely an ancillary issue to her petition for dissolution and the jurisdictional basis to decide it did not survive the voluntary dismissal of her petition. She relies on In re Marriage of Leopando , 96 Ill. 2d 114, 119-20, 70 Ill.Dec. 263, 449 N.E.2d 137 (1983), where our supreme court held that a dissolution proceeding constituted only a single claim, and therefore, rulings on other issues raised within that proceeding, such as custody matters, were merely ancillary issues and not separate claims individually appealable under Rule 304(a).\n¶ 48 More recently, however, our supreme court in Best , 228 Ill. 2d at 119, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939, found that an appellate court may consider a declaratory judgment motion concerning the validity and effect of a premarital agreement before a final dissolution order has been entered, as long as the requirements under section 2-701 have been met. In Best , the husband petitioned for dissolution of the marriage and later filed a motion, as part of the dissolution case and not as a separate action or case, for a declaratory judgment regarding the validity and construction of the parties' premarital agreement. Id. at 109-112, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. The trial court found the premarital agreement valid and enforceable and included Rule 304(a) language in its order; the husband appealed the order while the dissolution proceeding remained pending. Id. The Best court distinguished Leopando , observing that only the Marriage Act was at issue in Leopando , whereas the petitioner in Best sought not only nondeclaratory relief (dissolution of marriage) under the Marriage Act but also declaratory relief under section 2-701 and the Illinois Uniform Premarital Agreement Act ( 750 ILCS 10/1 et seq. (West 2004) ) (to address the validity and construction of the premarital agreement). Id. at 114-15, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. Unlike Leopando , \"the two requests for relief here had distinctly different statutory bases.\" Id. at 115, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. In further distinction, assuming the request for declaratory relief met the statutory requirements, a declaratory judgment could be entered even if the dissolution petition was not granted. Id. Additionally, the declaratory judgment in Best did not make actual awards in the pending dissolution matter, unlike in Leopando . Id. As such, the court held the petitioner's two actions in the dissolution proceeding were \"not so closely related that they must be deemed part of a single claim for relief, as they were in Leopando .\" Id.\n¶ 49 The petitioner in Best also argued that the termination-of-controversy requirement in section 2-701(a) was met despite the fact that ruling on the declaratory judgment motion would not resolve the dissolution petition or any claims for fees or support. Our supreme court held that because the Marriage Act incorporates the Civil Practice Law ( 735 ILCS 5/2-101 et seq. (West 2004) ), \"the legislature expressly provided for the entry of declaratory judgments in dissolution cases.\" Best , 228 Ill. 2d at 116, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. \"[A] reviewing court may consider the validity and effect of a declaratory judgment order in a dissolution proceeding, even if it is entered before the final dissolution order, if the prerequisites of the declaratory judgment statute are met.\" Id. at 119, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. Thus, the court concluded that under section 2-701(a), \"a declaratory judgment of the parties' rights under the premarital agreement is proper if: (1) there is an actual controversy; and (2) entry of a declaratory judgment would terminate 'some part' of that controversy ( 735 ILCS 5/2-701(a) (West 2004) ).\" Best , 228 Ill. 2d at 116-17, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. It was undisputed that an actual controversy existed in Best . The court found that the second statutory criterion was also met because a declaratory judgment would end \"some part\" of the controversy, i.e. , a ruling on the validity and application of the premarital agreement would determine various rights of the parties in the dissolution proceeding and \"terminate a significant part\" of the controversy. Id. at 117, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939.\n¶ 50 We also find Krol , 2015 IL App (1st) 140976, ¶ 22, 390 Ill.Dec. 501, 29 N.E.3d 433, helpful in analyzing whether Leonard's motion could stand on its own. In Krol , the father filed a petition for dissolution in Polish court and the mother subsequently filed a petition for dissolution and custody in the circuit court of Cook County. The father then filed a petition in the Cook County case under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89), requesting a decision on the habitual residence of the child. After the mother voluntarily dismissed her petition, this court held that the father's \"Hague petition should be treated as an independent action that survives the dismissal of the petition for dissolution of marriage\" given its independent statutory grounds and the \"Hague petition could have initiated a cause of action\" on its own. Id.\n¶ 51 Along similar lines, the court in Rife , 376 Ill. App. 3d at 1061-62, 316 Ill.Dec. 53, 878 N.E.2d 775, held that a petition for declaratory relief \"raised an independent controversy\" that satisfied the requirements of section 2-701(a), despite being filed after a dissolution judgment was entered. The respondent filed several petitions to modify the dissolution judgment, the petitioner filed responses, and the respondent then filed a petition for declaratory relief, claiming that the petitioner's response constituted a counterpetition and triggered a modification clause in the dissolution judgment. Id. at 1052-53, 316 Ill.Dec. 53, 878 N.E.2d 775. The petitioner asserted that the declaratory action would not terminate some or all of the controversy. Id. at 1061, 316 Ill.Dec. 53, 878 N.E.2d 775. The appellate court found the declaratory action \"raised an independent controversy, one that did not depend on the resolution of any other that was pending.\" Id. at 1062, 316 Ill.Dec. 53, 878 N.E.2d 775.\n¶ 52 Uliana argues that Leonard's motion for declaratory relief cannot stand on its own because there was no \"actual controversy\" remaining after she voluntarily dismissed her petition and (2) the motion for declaratory relief should have been dismissed because it failed to satisfy the \"termination of controversy\" requirement under section 2-701(a). She argues that upon voluntary dismissal of her petition, she essentially no longer disputed the enforceability of the agreement and Leonard's motion became moot.\n¶ 53 We find that both of the requirements for declaratory relief outlined in Best are satisfied in the present case. See Best , 228 Ill. 2d at 117, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. Our supreme court has explained that an \"actual controversy\" under section 2-701\n\"does not mean that a wrong must have been committed and injury inflicted. Rather, it requires a showing that the underlying facts and issues of the case are not moot or premature, so as to require the court to pass judgment on mere abstract propositions of law, render an advisory opinion, or give legal advice as to future events.\" Underground Contractors Ass'n v. City of Chicago , 66 Ill. 2d 371, 375, 5 Ill.Dec. 827, 362 N.E.2d 298 (1977).\nThe underlying purpose of section 2-701 is \"to allow the court to address a controversy one step sooner than normal, after a dispute has arisen but prior to any action which gives rise to a claim for damages or other relief.\" Delano Law Offices, P.C. v. Choi , 154 Ill. App. 3d 172, 173, 106 Ill.Dec. 923, 506 N.E.2d 723 (1987). As such, an actual controversy requires \"a concrete dispute admitting of an immediate and definitive determination of the parties' rights, the resolution of which will aid in the termination of the controversy or some part thereof.\" Underground Contractors , 66 Ill. 2d at 375, 5 Ill.Dec. 827, 362 N.E.2d 298.\n¶ 54 In the present case, at the time the circuit court considered Uliana's motion for voluntary dismissal of her petition for dissolution, an active controversy regarding the agreement remained. There were several matters pending before the court, e.g. , Leonard's motion for declaratory relief concerning the agreement, Uliana's countermotion for declaratory relief to find the agreement invalid, and Leonard's motion for leave to file a counterpetition for dissolution of marriage. Uliana had also filed a motion for injunctive relief claiming that Leonard violated the agreement in executing a will after she filed for divorce in which he left her one-eighth, instead of 40%, of his estate. Additionally, at the time the trial court considered and denied Uliana's subsequent motion to dismiss Leonard's declaratory judgment action, Leonard had already initiated a separate dissolution action by filing his own petition for dissolution, which remained pending. Notably, Uliana raised as counterclaims in Leonard's dissolution case the same arguments she raises against the declaratory judgment action in the present case. Thus, it is clear from the record that an actual controversy existed regarding the validity and enforceability of the agreement at the time the circuit court made the pertinent rulings. The validity and enforceability of the agreement was not merely an ancillary issue like in Leopando . Rather, it formed a separate claim for relief based on separate statutory grounds, similar to Best , Krol , and Rife .\n¶ 55 Additionally, we find the trial court's ruling on Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment would terminate \"some part\" of the parties' controversy. Best , 228 Ill. 2d at 117, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. As the supreme court observed in Best , 228 Ill. 2d at 117, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939, such a ruling would determine whether the premarital agreement controls \"various facets of the parties' rights in the pending dissolution proceeding.\"\n¶ 56 Uliana also contends that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Leonard did not file his motion as a separate pleading or counterclaim or pay a fee for filing a counterlcaim. However, in Best , the petitioner filed a motion for declaratory judgment as part of the dissolution case and not as a separate pleading or counterclaim. Id. at 110, 319 Ill.Dec. 815, 886 N.E.2d 939. Thus, the fact that Leonard's declaratory judgment request was not titled \"counterclaim\" did not deprive the circuit court of subject-matter jurisdiction. Moreover, \"the caption of a motion is not controlling; the character of the pleading is determined from its content, not its label.\" Sarkissian v. Chicago Board of Education , 201 Ill. 2d 95, 102, 267 Ill.Dec. 58, 776 N.E.2d 195 (2002) (citing Barnes v. Southern Ry. Co. , 116 Ill. 2d 236, 107 Ill.Dec. 581, 507 N.E.2d 494 (1987) ).\n¶ 57 Accordingly, we find that the court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment.\n¶ 58 C. Validity of the Antenuptial Agreement\n¶ 59 We now turn to Uliana's challenge to the trial court's decision to grant Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment and determination that the agreement was valid and enforceable.\n¶ 60 i. Illinois Uniform Premarital Agreement Act\n¶ 61 Uliana argues that the circuit court erred as a matter of law because it applied the Illinois Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (Premarital Agreement Act) ( 750 ILCS 10/1 et seq. (West 2014) ). Uliana points to the trial court's statement in its written order that \"the parties may have contemplated a short marriage and the court observes that the Premarital Agreement Act enacted after the parties' marriage the court believes redefines penury differently than prior case law.\"\n¶ 62 It is undisputed that the Premarital Agreement Act does not apply to the agreement here, which the parties executed on October 9, 1984. See Heinrich , 2014 IL App (2d) 121333, ¶ 49, 380 Ill.Dec. 26, 7 N.E.3d 889 (the Premarital Agreement Act applies to \"any prenuptial agreement executed on or after January 1, 1990\") A closer examination of the circuit court's written order demonstrates that it understood it was applying common law and not the Premarital Agreement Act. The trial court's reference to the Premarital Agreement Act was merely a general observation, as it noted that the Premarital Agreement Act was enacted after the parties entered into the agreement. The circuit court made findings specific to pre-Premarital Agreement Act decisional law.\n¶ 63 Prior to the enactment of the Premarital Agreement Act, Illinois common law provided that a premarital agreement that governed property and maintenance rights was\n\"valid and enforceable as long as three conditions are met: (1) the agreement does not create an unforeseen condition of penury due to one spouse's lack of property or employability; (2) the parties entered into the agreement with full knowledge, free of fraud, duress, or coercion; and (3) the agreement is fair and reasonable.\" Berger v. Berger , 357 Ill. App. 3d 651, 656, 293 Ill.Dec. 954, 829 N.E.2d 879 (2005).\n¶ 64 Here, the circuit court held that the agreement was fair and reasonable; was not the product of fraud, duress, or coercion; that Uliana had the opportunity to read and understand the agreement and consult with counsel; and that Uliana entered into the agreement voluntarily. At the hearing on Leonard's motion, the court observed that \"penury is not in the present statute\" and stated that it was holding \"as a matter of law\" penury did not exist at the time the agreement was executed in 1984.\n¶ 65 In contrast, under the Premarital Agreement Act, a premarital agreement is unenforceable if the party challenging it proves that\n\"(1) he or she did not execute the agreement voluntarily; or (2) the agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution of the agreement, the party was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the other's property, did not waive the right to such disclosure in writing, and did not have (and could not reasonably have had) an adequate knowledge of the other's property.\" Heinrich , 2014 IL App (2d) 121333, ¶ 49, 380 Ill.Dec. 26, 7 N.E.3d 889 (citing 750 ILCS 10/7(a) (West 2012) ).\nHere, the circuit court made no findings regarding whether the agreement was unconscionable or whether there was full financial disclosure.\n¶ 66 Accordingly, we find that the trial court applied the correct law in assessing the validity of the agreement. Regardless, \"[a] court of review may affirm a trial court's judgment upon any ground appearing in the record, regardless of whether it was relied upon by the trial court and regardless of whether the reasoning of the trial court was correct.\" In re Marriage of Lehr , 317 Ill. App. 3d 853, 862, 251 Ill.Dec. 336, 740 N.E.2d 417 (2000) ; see also In re Marriage of Murphy , 359 Ill. App. 3d 289, 300, 295 Ill.Dec. 831, 834 N.E.2d 56 (2005).\n¶ 67 ii. Penury\n¶ 68 Uliana contends that, contrary to the circuit court's ruling, the agreement should be invalidated as it created an unforeseen condition of penury given her poor health, medical costs, and her lack of employability due to her age, health, and the fact that she stopped working shortly after getting married. Berger , 357 Ill. App. 3d at 656, 293 Ill.Dec. 954, 829 N.E.2d 879.\n¶ 69 Here, the court found that at the time the parties signed the agreement, it did not create an unforeseen condition of penury and was fair and reasonable given the parties' age difference, the maintenance provision and the estate provision, and the fact that they may have contemplated a short marriage.\n¶ 70 In comparison, in Warren v. Warren , 169 Ill. App. 3d 226, 228, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680 (1988), the premarital agreement gave the wife no rights to marital property, maintenance, or attorney fees upon dissolution of marriage. The wife worked as a secretary before marriage and had a net worth of $70,000, while her oil executive husband had a net worth of $7 million. The parties lived together for three years before getting married, and she quit her job at the husband's request. Id. at 228, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680. Although the court ultimately found the total waiver of maintenance provision unenforceable on other grounds, the court concluded that the wife would not be reduced to an unforeseen condition of penury because, although her assets were modest in comparison, they were sufficient, and the fact that she voluntarily quit her employment one year before the marriage made her lack of future employability foreseeable. Id. at 230-31, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680.\n¶ 71 Similarly, in In re Marriage of Barnes , 324 Ill. App. 3d 514, 522-23, 258 Ill.Dec. 139, 755 N.E.2d 522 (2001), the appellate court upheld the parties' premarital agreement in which the wife waived all maintenance other than a stipulated amount tied to the length of the marriage ($10,000 after seven years of marriage). The court found that the agreement \"reflected the gross disparity in the parties' assets and income at the time of marriage.\" Id. at 523, 258 Ill.Dec. 139, 755 N.E.2d 522. Although the wife enjoyed a lifestyle beyond what she could have afforded on her own and was earning a salary of only $24,000 at the time of trial, there was no undue hardship or unforeseen circumstances considering she knew the husband's income far exceeded her own at the time she entered into the agreement and the fact that it was the husband's fifth marriage. Id. at 523-24, 258 Ill.Dec. 139, 755 N.E.2d 522.\n¶ 72 Based on Warren and Barnes , we find no error in the circuit court's decision here. Unlike in Warren , where the agreement provided for absolutely no financial settlement upon divorce, Uliana was entitled to receive a monthly payment in maintenance which increased in amount and number of months in proportion to the length of the parties' marriage. As the parties were married for over 30 years at the time the petition was filed, Uliana was to receive $2500 per month for 100 months. The agreement further provides Uliana with all property in her name, such as the house in Michigan worth $200,000, in addition to half of all marital property. The agreement further required Leonard to leave Uliana 40% of his net estate upon death.\n¶ 73 In addition, Uliana was familiar of Leonard's income and wealth before signing the agreement. Uliana lived with Leonard for approximately one or two years before the parties married. They lived in a 3500 square foot apartment which costs $3500 per month, and he would give her money as needed and he was supporting her financially before they married. Thus, similar to the situation in Barnes , the agreement reflected the parties' disparity of income and assets before the marriage. It was foreseeable that a withdrawal of this support in the future would affect her standard of living. At the time the parties signed the agreement, Uliana was working full time in a real estate office, paying for her own vehicle, and earning \"a couple hundred dollars\" per week. Given that she quit her job shortly after the parties signed the agreement and married, her claimed lack of employability was foreseeable. We note that Uliana testified that she currently manages four residential real estate rental properties for Leonard. She had previously worked at other positions of responsibility, including managing a health club, she possessed a college education and is fluent in several languages.\n¶ 74 The court found that at the time the parties signed the agreement, it did not create an unforeseen condition of penury and was fair and reasonable given the parties' age difference, the maintenance provision and the estate provision, and the fact that they may have contemplated a short marriage. We cannot say that the court's factual determinations in that regard were manifestly erroneous. See Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London , 2014 IL App (1st) 132020, ¶ 50, 384 Ill.Dec. 354, 16 N.E.3d 747. Considering that the maintenance and property waiver provisions are more generous here than in Warren , we find no error in the trial court's determination that, at the time of signing, the agreement would not give rise to an unforeseen condition of penury.\n¶ 75 In asserting that the trial court erred, Uliana relies on cases from other jurisdictions. See Hill v. Hill , 356 N.W.2d 49, 55-58 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984) (upholding validity of antenuptial agreement but finding that the maintenance provision was unconscionable under Minnesota law given the wife's poor health, emotional problems, and lack of earning capacity). \"The decisions of foreign courts are not binding on Illinois courts * * *.\" People v. Applewhite , 2016 IL App (1st) 142330, ¶ 23, 409 Ill.Dec. 849, 68 N.E.3d 957. We are persuaded by Warren and Barnes .\nÂ¶ 76 iii. Duress and Undue Influence\n¶ 77 We next address jointly Uliana's contentions that the circuit court erred in finding that the agreement was not procured under duress or by undue influence, as she raises similar arguments for each issue. She asserts that a confidential relationship existed between her and Leonard, that she was 16 years younger than him, foreign born, a non-native English speaker, from a sheltered background with less education, and was physically ill due to her pregnancy when she signed the agreement.\n¶ 78 \"Duress has been defined as including the imposition, oppression, undue influence or the taking of undue advantage of the stress of another whereby one is deprived of the exercise of his free will.\" In re Marriage of Hamm-Smith , 261 Ill. App. 3d 209, 215, 198 Ill.Dec. 763, 633 N.E.2d 225 (1994). Undue influence is an improper \"urgency of persuasion whereby the will of a person is overpowered and he is induced to do or forbear an act which he would not do or would do if left to act freely.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Kuster v. Schaumburg , 276 Ill. App. 3d 220, 224, 212 Ill.Dec. 980, 658 N.E.2d 462 (1995). \"The person asserting duress has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that he was bereft of the quality of mind essential to the making of the contract.\" Hamm-Smith , 261 Ill. App. 3d at 215, 198 Ill.Dec. 763, 633 N.E.2d 225.\n¶ 79 We find no error in the trial court's determination that Uliana did not enter into the agreement under duress. \"One party's agreement to marry is in and of itself sufficient consideration for financial concessions by the other party in the context of a premarital agreement.\" Barnes , 324 Ill. App. 3d at 519, 258 Ill.Dec. 139, 755 N.E.2d 522. Conditioning marriage on the execution of the agreement did not constitute coercion. Id. Both parties could have remained single. Both parties testified that they did not particularly want to marry each other but did so primarily to avoid the stigma attached to having a baby out of wedlock within their religious and cultural traditions. Considering the testimony presented, the trial court's factual determinations were not manifestly erroneous. See Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London , 2014 IL App (1st) 132020, ¶ 50, 384 Ill.Dec. 354, 16 N.E.3d 747. According to Uliana's own testimony, she did not want to marry Leonard; she informed Leonard that she wanted to have the baby and she did not \"need to be married. * * * I am not looking for marriage, but I will not kill another baby.\" Despite Uliana's assertion on appeal that she was unable to support herself, was dependent on Leonard at the time she executed the agreement, and that she was in \"desperate straits, both emotionally and financially,\" she testified that she told Leonard she was prepared to go ahead with the pregnancy without him. She initially refused to sign the agreement, telling Leonard that \"I don't need to marry you. * * * I am happy to have a child and to raise a child.\" Uliana was 29 years old at the time she signed the agreement. She had survived cancer at the young age of 24. She worked her way through college without debt, was making payments on her own automobile, had held several positions of responsibility in the workforce, and was working full time. She had lived in different countries and spoke four languages.\n¶ 80 Although Uliana argues that she was ill at the time due to the pregnancy, she nevertheless testified that she was still working. She also obtained a lawyer, had him examine the agreement and explain it to her, and had various revisions and drafts made. Despite Uliana's contention that she did not feel well on the evening she signed the agreement and the wedding occurred, she had several weeks to review it prior to that evening. She received the agreement in September, reviewed it with her lawyer, had a copy at home, and did not sign it until October. She also conceded that she was presented with the exhibit attached to the agreement that disclosed Leonard's assets, debts, and income. There was no evidence that anyone rushed her to sign the agreement or prevented her from reading it again that evening. In sum, the evidence did not establish that, due to her difficult pregnancy, Uliana was \"bereft of the quality of mind essential to the making of the contract.\" Hamm-Smith , 261 Ill. App. 3d at 215, 198 Ill.Dec. 763, 633 N.E.2d 225. An opposite conclusion is not clearly apparent. See Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London , 2014 IL App (1st) 132020, ¶ 50, 384 Ill.Dec. 354, 16 N.E.3d 747.\n¶ 81 Uliana contends that she faced tremendous pressure to get married from her father and Leonard's father. However, the testimony from both parties indicated that this pressure did not come from Leonard. He simply presented her with a premarital agreement and stated that they could get married if she signed it. Even if we were to consider the actions of the parties' fathers, \"threats cannot constitute duress unless they are legally or morally wrong,\" ( Barnes , 324 Ill. App. 3d at 519, 258 Ill.Dec. 139, 755 N.E.2d 522 ), and there was no evidence that they did anything legally or morally wrong that would amount to coercing Uliana to sign the agreement. The evidence did not establish that the fathers' attempts to convince their children to marry to avoid having a child out of wedlock deprived Uliana of the exercise of her free will. See Hamm-Smith , 261 Ill. App. 3d at 215, 198 Ill.Dec. 763, 633 N.E.2d 225.\n¶ 82 In addition, the agreement itself provided that it had been reviewed by each party with the assistance of counsel of their choice who advised them regarding the agreement and their rights, and it \"is believed by them to be fair, just, and equitable with respect to each of them.\" It provided that the agreement was made and entered into by the parties \"consequent to a full, fair, and complete disclosure by each of the said parties to the other of the nature, extent, and value or his or her property, assets indebtedness, and income.\" Uliana does not dispute that she initialed each page and signed the document. See Warren , 169 Ill. App. 3d at 229-30, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680 (finding that the wife signed the premarital agreement knowingly and in absence of any fraud or coercion where she had opportunity to seek legal counsel, the agreement was explained by the husband's counsel prior to signing, she was not inexperienced in the ways of the business world, the husband provided a general disclosure of his financial status, and she lived with him and had worked for the same company, the marriage occurred two months after the agreement was executed, and the wife was in good spirits at the time of execution despite her own testimony that she cried on the way to sign the agreement).\n¶ 83 In conjunction with her undue influence claim, Uliana asserts that Leonard took advantage of a confidential relationship between them as they were engaged to be married. \"Parties engaged to be married, prior to signing a prenuptial agreement, are in a confidential relationship with each other.\" In re Marriage of Drag , 326 Ill. App. 3d 1051, 1056, 261 Ill.Dec. 184, 762 N.E.2d 1111 (2002).\n\"[I]f the provisions made for the wife are disproportionate to the extent and value of the husband's estate, the presumption is raised that the husband intentionally concealed his assets, and the burden shifts to those claiming the validity of the agreement to prove that the wife had full knowledge of the husband's property.\" In re Estate of Hopkins , 166 Ill. App. 3d 652, 656, 117 Ill.Dec. 254, 520 N.E.2d 415 (1988).\nHowever, \"[t]his presumption arises only when there is an engagement between the parties, placing them in a confidential relationship.\" In re Marriage of Sokolowski , 232 Ill. App. 3d 535, 543, 173 Ill.Dec. 701, 597 N.E.2d 675 (1992).\n¶ 84 Here, the testimony showed that the parties were cohabitating and Uliana was pregnant, but they were not actually engaged. Moreover, there was no evidence that Leonard used any \"confidential relationship\" to coerce Uliana into signing the agreement and marrying him. Rather, the testimony showed that the parties did not particularly wish to be married but their families wanted them to because of the pregnancy. Leonard did not propose marriage to Uliana; rather, he informed her that if she would sign a prenuptial agreement, they could marry. Indeed, Leonard testified that he was dating another woman up until the day they signed the agreement and he married Uliana. Thus, Leonard did not have the burden of proving that Uliana was aware of the value and extent of his property. See id. At any rate, even if he did, there was no dispute that Leonard provided such a disclosure a document attached to the agreement and Uliana had already been living with Leonard for some time and was undoubtedly aware of his financial position. The circuit court's factual determinations in that regard were not manifestly erroneous. See Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London , 2014 IL App (1st) 132020, ¶ 50, 384 Ill.Dec. 354, 16 N.E.3d 747.\n¶ 85 We note that Uliana asserts that Leonard made last minute changes to the agreement before they signed it. However, based on Leonard's testimony and the copy of the agreement presented to the court, the change he made inured to her benefit and it was initialed by both parties. Leonard increased the number of months Uliana would receive $1000 in maintenance payments from 24 to 36 months if the parties were married for less than 24 months.\n¶ 86 iv. Fairness and Reasonableness\n¶ 87 Uliana asserts that the agreement was not fair and reasonable because $2500 per month for 100 months is insufficient and unfair given her health costs, standard of living, and Leonard's wealth, and the total amount she can receive is capped at $250,000, reduced by any amounts Leonard pays for temporary maintenance or attorney fees to Uliana's counsel.\n¶ 88 \"Although marriage is sufficient legal consideration for an antenuptial agreement [citation], the agreement must be fair and reasonable. Illinois requires that an antenuptial agreement guarantee both parties an equitable financial settlement in lieu of a waiver of their rights to property or maintenance.\" Warren , 169 Ill. App. 3d at 231, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680.\n¶ 89 Uliana likens the present case to the circumstances in Warren . There, the court held that although the premarital agreement would not create an unforeseen condition of penury and it was not the product of coercion or fraud, it found the total waiver of maintenance provision in the agreement was not \"fair and reasonable\" under the circumstances. Id. at 231-32, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680. It provided \"no financial settlement whatsoever\" to the wife, and the couple had enjoyed \"a lifestyle far more extravagant than [the wife] could hope to afford on her own\" for several years. Id. at 231, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680. The wife had not worked since before the marriage and had $33,000 in assets, while the husband was worth $1.5 to $2 million, with $700,000 in debts. Id. at 229, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680. In addition, the provision requiring the parties to pay their own attorney fees upon dissolution was not fair and reasonable given the husband's superior financial position and the fact that he instituted the dissolution proceedings. Id. at 231, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680 ; see also Kolflat v. Kolflat , 636 So.2d 87, 90 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1994) (applying Illinois law to hold that while the premarital agreement did not create an unforeseen condition of penury and was not procured by fraud or duress, the maintenance waiver provision was unfair where the husband's net worth was over $4.7 million, while the wife had $109,000 in assets, was over 50 years old, lacked a college education or work skills, and the agreement provided absolutely no financial support to the wife).\n¶ 90 In contrast, in In re Marriage of Burgess , 138 Ill. App. 3d 13, 15-16, 92 Ill.Dec. 693, 485 N.E.2d 504 (1985), the court upheld the waiver of maintenance provision in the parties' premarital agreement where the wife had a net worth of over $400,000 before marriage, her husband did not receive any of her premarital assets, she had yearly investment income of over $38,000, and she had sufficient funds to furnish her new household. See also Drag , 326 Ill. App. 3d at 1057, 261 Ill.Dec. 184, 762 N.E.2d 1111 (upholding maintenance provision where the wife was receiving over $200,000 in addition to a monthly maintenance award of $1400 for six years).\n¶ 91 Considering the circumstances in the present case, we cannot say that the trial court erred in finding the agreement fair and reasonable. The trial court observed that the agreement's financial provisions \"may have been on the low side of fair and reasonable but even so especially when coupled with the award of a portion of Leonard Kranzler's estate, given the age differences between the parties, that the Antenuptial Agreement is fair and reasonable.\" As stated, the agreement did not leave Uliana without a financial settlement and did not involve a complete waiver of maintenance. She was entitled to receive $2500 per month for 100 months because the parties were married for more than 180 months. In addition, she retains her property in Michigan, which has an estimated value of $200,000, and all other premarital property. She is also entitled to half of all jointly titled marital property upon resolution of the dissolution case. We further note that, unlike the wife in Warren , who lacked a college education or any specific work skills, Uliana has a college degree and she presently manages four rental properties As the trial court observed, the agreement also provided that Uliana was entitled to 40% of his net estate upon his death if the parties remain married at the time of death.\n¶ 92 We further note that the dissolution case remained pending at the time the circuit court determined the validity of the agreement. The circuit court stated that it was finding the agreement to be valid and enforceable, but noted that it would make further rulings in the future and \"hear the condition of the parties in a trial.\" See Warren , 169 Ill. App. 3d at 231, 119 Ill.Dec. 924, 523 N.E.2d 680 ; Burgess , 138 Ill. App. 3d at 15, 92 Ill.Dec. 693, 485 N.E.2d 504 (a court may find a premarital agreement valid, but nevertheless modify a maintenance provision it finds unfair or unreasonable in order to mitigate the potential harm to a spouse that could result in the strict enforcement of such provisions if it find enforcement would result in the spouse becoming a public charge to due lack of resources, \"a catastrophic illness or other severe physical or mental impairment\").\n¶ 93 v. Unconscionability\n¶ 94 Uliana contends that the agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable and the trial court erred in failing to find it unconscionable. As Leonard argues, unconscionability is not part of the common law analysis. See Berger , 357 Ill. App. 3d at 656, 293 Ill.Dec. 954, 829 N.E.2d 879 ; Heinrich , 2014 IL App (2d) 121333, ¶ 49, 380 Ill.Dec. 26, 7 N.E.3d 889. The trial court made no specific finding as to unconscionability.\n¶ 95 However, \"[t]he rules governing the interpretation of contracts apply to the interpretation of prenuptial agreements.\" Drag , 326 Ill. App. 3d at 1055, 261 Ill.Dec. 184, 762 N.E.2d 1111. \"The test for establishing an unconscionable contract is to determine whether the agreement is one which no reasonable person would make and no honest person would accept.\" Id.\n¶ 96 In support of her contention regarding unconscionability, Uliana cites and reiterates the same arguments she made in contending that the agreement was the product of duress and undue influence and was not fair and reasonable. Consistent with our prior analysis regarding these issues, we find that Uliana has not shown that the agreement was so unconscionable such that it involved \"a lack of meaningful choice by one party\" under the circumstances. Id.\n¶ 97 III. CONCLUSION\n¶ 98 For the reasons stated, we affirm the circuit court's order allowing Leonard's motion for declaratory judgment to stand on its own and its order finding the premarital agreement valid and enforceable. The parties' briefs adequately relay their respective contentions and adequately respond thereto, indicating that oral argument would not further our consideration of this appeal.\n¶ 99 Affirmed.\nPresiding Justice McBride and Justice Ellis concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOn October 21, 2016, Uliana filed a motion for mandatory temporary injunctive relief, arguing that the agreement provided that Leonard shall leave 40% of his net estate to Uliana if they were married at the time of his death and had been married for more than 20 years. Uliana asserted that Leonard executed a will in which he left her only one-eighth of his estate.\nIn ruling, we note that, at several points in his response brief, Leonard requests this court take notice of matters outside the record and refers to documents that were not part of the instant proceeding in the circuit court. We previously denied his motion to supplement the record. While we decline Uliana's request to strike his brief en toto , we disregard any improper argument or reference to facts not supported by the available lower court record. \"[A] party may not rely on matters outside the record to support its position on appeal * * *.\" In re Marriage of Reidy , 2018 IL App (1st) 170054, ¶ 20, --- Ill.Dec. ----, --- N.E.3d ----. See In re Marriage of Iqbal , 2014 IL App (2d) 131306, ¶ 14, 381 Ill.Dec. 638, 11 N.E.3d 1 (striking a brief for failure to comply with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 341 (eff. Mar. 16, 2007) is \"a harsh sanction\" appropriate \"only when the procedural violations interfere with our review\").",

                            "text": "JUSTICE REYES delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n¶ 1 The instant appeal arises from the circuit court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, Iwan Ries & Co.; Cigar Association of America, Inc.; Illinois Association of Wholesale Distributors; Illinois Retail Merchants Association; International Premium Cigar and Pipe Retailers Association; National Association of Tobacco Outlets, Inc.; and Arangold Corporation d/b/a Arango Cigar Co., which operated to strike down the City of Chicago Other Tobacco Products Tax Ordinance (ordinance) (Chicago Municipal Code § 3-49 (added Mar. 16, 2016) ). The circuit court found that the City of Chicago's home rule authority to enact the ordinance was preempted by section 8-11-6a(2) of the Illinois Municipal Code (Municipal Code) ( 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6a(2) (West 2016) ). Defendants, the City of Chicago and Erin Keane in her capacity as the Comptroller of the Department of Finance (collectively the City), appeal, and for the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n¶ 2 BACKGROUND\n¶ 3 The center of the dispute in this matter is the ordinance enacted by the Chicago City Council on March 16, 2016, which created flat taxes on units of non-cigarette tobacco products including smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, little cigars, and large cigars sold and used within Chicago. Chicago Municipal Code § 3-49-30 (added Mar. 16, 2016).\n¶ 4 Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on May 26, 2016, requesting the circuit court declare the ordinance unconstitutional pursuant to article VII, section 6(g), of the Illinois Constitution and to permanently enjoin its enforcement. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, § 6 (g). Plaintiffs maintained that the City's home rule power to tax non-cigarette tobacco products was preempted by section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code ( 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6a(2) (West 2016) ), which provides that \"a home rule municipality that has not imposed a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products before July 1, 1993, shall not impose such a tax after that date.\" Plaintiffs alleged that the City could not impose this new tax on non-cigarette products because it had previously taxed only cigarettes (not non-cigarette products) before July 1, 1993.\n¶ 5 Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a three-count amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief: count I sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unauthorized because it was preempted by section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code; count II sought a permanent injunction; and count III sought a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction as to other regulatory provisions not at issue in this appeal that imposed price floors for non-cigarette tobacco products, prohibited the use of coupons, and imposed minimum packaging requirements for certain tobacco products.\n¶ 6 Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment on counts I and II of the amended complaint, addressing the sole issue of whether section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code preempts the City's home rule authority to impose the ordinance. The parties were in agreement that the City had in place, as of July 1, 1993, a tax on cigarettes. Plaintiffs maintained that the plain language of section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code only allowed a home rule authority to enact a tax on \"tobacco products\" if such a tax was in existence prior to July 1, 1993. Because the City had not enacted a tax on the other tobacco products as listed in the ordinance, they could not do so now. In response, the City maintained that it was not preempted from enacting the ordinance because it was merely required to have a tax in place before July 1, 1993, on either cigarettes or \"tobacco products.\"\n¶ 7 After the matter was fully briefed and argued, the circuit court ruled that section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code preempted the City's authority to enact the ordinance and thus granted plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and denied the City's motion. Thereafter, the circuit court entered an order pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). This appeal followed.\n¶ 8 ANALYSIS\n¶ 9 This appeal requires us to determine whether or not section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code ( 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6a(2) (West 2016) ) preempts the City's home rule authority to enact the ordinance that taxes tobacco products other than cigarettes. See Chicago Municipal Code § 3-49-020 (added Mar. 16, 2016) (specifically excluding from its definition of \"[o]ther [t]obacco [p]roducts\" cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, and liquid nicotine products).\n¶ 10 The City contends that the ordinance is a valid exercise of its home rule authority. The City maintains that because it had imposed a tax on cigarettes prior to July 1, 1993, it falls within the exception of section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code, which it contends must be read to provide for a tax on either cigarettes or non-cigarette tobacco products prior to July 1, 1993. 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6a(2) (West 2016). The City reasons that because it taxed cigarettes, a tax within the category of cigarettes or non-cigarette tobacco products, prior to July 1, 1993, the ordinance is valid. The City concedes that no tax on \"tobacco products\" other than cigarettes had been implemented prior to July 1, 1993.\n¶ 11 In response, plaintiffs contend that section 8-11-6a(2) unambiguously provides that the City, a home rule municipality, cannot impose a tax on tobacco products unless the municipality imposed such a tax prior to July 1, 1993. According to plaintiffs, the use of the phrase \"such a tax\" in section 8-11-6a(2) refers to a tax on either \"cigarettes or tobacco products.\" Id. Plaintiffs reason that, because \"such a tax\" is a singular modifier, it can only be referring to a separate tax on cigarettes or a separate tax on other tobacco products. Plaintiffs maintain that because the City did not impose a tax on tobacco products prior to July 1, 1993, the City is precluded from enacting the ordinance.\n¶ 12 We first set forth our standard of review. This matter comes before us after the disposition of cross-motions for summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits, viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmovant, fail to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists, thereby entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law. 735 ILCS 5/2-1005(c) (West 2016); Fox v. Seiden , 2016 IL App (1st) 141984, ¶ 12, 403 Ill.Dec. 368, 53 N.E.3d 1005. When, as here, parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, they agree that no genuine issues of material fact exist and they invite the court to decide the case as a matter of law based on the record. Casey's Marketing Co. v. Hamer , 2016 IL App (1st) 143485, ¶ 11, 401 Ill.Dec. 842, 51 N.E.3d 35. We review a circuit court's decision to grant summary judgment de novo . Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. , 2015 IL App (1st) 132350, ¶ 8, 389 Ill.Dec. 331, 26 N.E.3d 421. As the principal issue we are asked to resolve necessarily involves matters of statutory construction, we also observe our review in that regard is de novo . Stasko v. City of Chicago , 2013 IL App (1st) 120265, ¶ 31, 375 Ill.Dec. 664, 997 N.E.2d 975. De novo consideration means we perform the same analysis that a trial judge would perform. Midwest Gaming & Entertainment, LLC v. County of Cook , 2015 IL App (1st) 142786, ¶ 46, 395 Ill.Dec. 819, 39 N.E.3d 286.\n¶ 13 To determine whether or not the City's home rule authority to enact the ordinance is preempted by section 8-11-6a(2), we must necessarily begin by discussing our constitution and the power it grants to home rule units. The relationship between our state and local governments was aptly recounted by our supreme court in City of Chicago v. StubHub, Inc. , 2011 IL 111127, 366 Ill.Dec. 43, 979 N.E.2d 844 :\n\"Under the 1870 Illinois Constitution, the balance of power between our state and local governments was heavily weighted toward the state. The 1970 Illinois Constitution drastically altered that balance, giving local governments more autonomy. Schillerstrom Homes, Inc. v. City of Naperville , 198 Ill. 2d 281, 286-87, 260 Ill.Dec. 835, 762 N.E.2d 494 (2001) ; City of Evanston v. Create, Inc. , 85 Ill. 2d 101, 107, 51 Ill.Dec. 688, 421 N.E.2d 196 (1981) (quoting 4 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 3024). Municipalities now enjoy 'the broadest powers possible' ( Scadron v. City of Des Plaines , 153 Ill. 2d 164, 174, 180 Ill.Dec. 77, 606 N.E.2d 1154 (1992) ) under the Constitution.\" Id. ¶ 18.\nThe court went on to explain that section 6(a) of article VII, \"gives municipalities any powers pertaining to their governments and affairs, including the power to tax, but not the power over matters such as divorce, real property, trusts, and contracts (7 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 1621).\" Id. ¶ 19. Thus, \"[t]he framers' intent was clear: 'the powers of home-rule units relate to their own problems,' not problems more competently solved by the state.\" Id. (quoting 7 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 1621). The court also observed that, \"[t]he framers * * * understood that further interpretation of section 6 (a)'s intentionally imprecise language would fall to the judicial branch.\" Id. (citing 4 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 3052).\n¶ 14 Under the Illinois Constitution, except as limited by article VII, section 6 of the constitution, a home rule unit such as the City \"may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs including, but not limited to, the power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; to license; to tax; and to incur debt.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, § 6 (a). \"Section 6(a) was written with the intention to give home rule units the broadest powers possible.\" Palm v. 2800 Lake Shore Drive Condominium Ass'n , 2013 IL 110505, ¶ 30, 370 Ill.Dec. 299, 988 N.E.2d 75. Furthermore, the constitution expressly provides that the \"[p]owers and functions of home rule units shall be construed liberally.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, § 6 (m).\n¶ 15 The General Assembly, however, \"may * * * preempt the exercise of a municipality's home rule powers by expressly limiting that authority.\" Palm , 2013 IL 110505, ¶ 31, 370 Ill.Dec. 299, 988 N.E.2d 75. Under article VII, section 6(h), \"[t]he General Assembly may provide specifically by law for the exclusive exercise by the State of any power or function of a home rule unit other than a taxing power.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, § 6 (h). With respect to the power to tax, \"[t]he General Assembly by a law approved by the vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house may deny or limit the power to tax and any other power or function of a home rule unit not exercised or performed by the State.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, § 6 (g).\n¶ 16 \"If the legislature intends to limit or deny the exercise of home rule powers, the statute must contain an express statement to that effect.\" Palm , 2013 IL 110505, ¶ 31, 370 Ill.Dec. 299, 988 N.E.2d 75. If the legislature does not do so, article VII, section 6(i), provides that \"[h]ome rule units may exercise and perform concurrently with the State any power or function of a home rule unit to the extent that the General Assembly by law does not specifically limit the concurrent exercise or specifically declare the State's exercise to be exclusive.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, § 6 (i). Thus, the Illinois Constitution provides home rule units with the same powers as the sovereign, except when those powers are limited by the General Assembly. City of Chicago v. Roman , 184 Ill. 2d 504, 513, 235 Ill.Dec. 468, 705 N.E.2d 81 (1998) (citing Triple A Services, Inc. v. Rice , 131 Ill. 2d 217, 230, 137 Ill.Dec. 53, 545 N.E.2d 706 (1989) ). Our supreme court has \"consistently recognized that the home rule provisions of the Illinois Constitution are intended to 'eliminate or at least reduce to a bare minimum the circumstances under which local home rule powers are preempted by judicial interpretation of unexpressed legislative intention.' \" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Palm , 2013 IL 110505, ¶ 34, 370 Ill.Dec. 299, 988 N.E.2d 75 (quoting Scadron v. City of Des Plaines , 153 Ill. 2d 164, 186, 180 Ill.Dec. 77, 606 N.E.2d 1154 (1992) ); see also Schillerstrom Homes, Inc. v. City of Naperville , 198 Ill. 2d 281, 288, 260 Ill.Dec. 835, 762 N.E.2d 494 (2001) ; Roman , 184 Ill. 2d at 516, 235 Ill.Dec. 468, 705 N.E.2d 81.\n¶ 17 In this instance, the parties agree that the legislature granted the City, a home rule unit, the authority to tax cigarettes pursuant to section 8-11-6(a) of the Municipal Code, which provides as follows:\n\"Except as provided in Sections 8-11-1, 8-11-5, 8-11-6, 8-11-6b, 8-11-6c, and 11-74.3-6 on and after September 1, 1990, no home rule municipality has the authority to impose, pursuant to its home rule authority, a retailer's occupation tax, service occupation tax, use tax, sales tax or other tax on the use, sale or purchase of tangible personal property based on the gross receipts from such sales or the selling or purchase price of said tangible personal property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section does not preempt any home rule imposed tax such as the following : * * * (2) a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products (provided, however, that a home rule municipality that has not imposed a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products before July 1, 1993, shall not impose such a tax after that date) ; * * *. * * * This Section is a limitation, pursuant to subsection (g) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, on the power of home rule units to tax.\" (Emphasis added.) 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6a (West 2016).\nWhat is at issue, however, is whether section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code preempts the City's authority to tax \"tobacco products\" as provided in the ordinance where the City had not imposed a tax specifically on \"tobacco products\" prior to July 1, 1993. The answer to this question requires us to interpret this particular section of the Municipal Code, which we do de novo . Stasko , 2013 IL App (1st) 120265, ¶ 31, 375 Ill.Dec. 664, 997 N.E.2d 975.\n¶ 18 The fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the drafter's intent. Hubble v. Bi-State Development Agency of the Illinois-Missouri Metropolitan District , 238 Ill. 2d 262, 268, 345 Ill.Dec. 44, 938 N.E.2d 483 (2010). The statutory language, given its plain and ordinary meaning, is the best indication of that intent. Palm , 2013 IL 110505, ¶ 48, 370 Ill.Dec. 299, 988 N.E.2d 75. \"A reasonable construction must be given to each word, clause, and sentence of a statute, and no term should be rendered superfluous.\" 1010 Lake Shore Ass'n v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. , 2015 IL 118372, ¶ 21, 398 Ill.Dec. 95, 43 N.E.3d 1005. When determining a statute's meaning, the statute should be read as a whole, with all relevant parts considered. Gardner v. Mullins , 234 Ill. 2d 503, 511, 334 Ill.Dec. 617, 917 N.E.2d 443 (2009). A court may not depart from the plain statutory language by reading into it exceptions, limitations, or conditions not expressed by the legislature. In re Estate of Ellis , 236 Ill. 2d 45, 51, 337 Ill.Dec. 678, 923 N.E.2d 237 (2009). \"Where statutory language is clear and unambiguous, it will be given effect without resort to other aids of construction.\" Bettis v. Marsaglia , 2014 IL 117050, ¶ 13, 387 Ill.Dec. 659, 23 N.E.3d 351.\n¶ 19 \"An examination of the validity of home rule authority requires the court to determine whether the questioned home rule ordinance is related to its government and affairs and whether the state legislature has preempted the exercise of the home rule power.\" Page v. City of Chicago , 299 Ill. App. 3d 450, 460, 233 Ill.Dec. 575, 701 N.E.2d 218 (1998). In this case, there is no question as to whether the ordinance is related to the City's government and affairs, rather the primary issue is whether section 8-11-6a(2) of the Municipal Code preempts the City's home rule authority to tax other tobacco products.\n¶ 20 We begin by reviewing the history of the relevant provision of the Municipal Code as we find it to be both helpful and instructive. See Illinois Chiropractic Society v. Giello , 18 Ill. 2d 306, 312, 164 N.E.2d 47 (1960) (when a statute has been amended, courts are to construe the language of the amendment together with the original act).\n¶ 21 Section 8-11-6a was originally enacted in 1988 and expressly limited a home rule municipality from imposing certain taxes on the use, sale, or purchase of tangible personal property. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 24, ¶ 8-11-6a (stating this section \"is a limitation, pursuant to subsection (g) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, on the power of home rule units to tax\"). The legislature, however, allowed for certain exceptions to this rule and set forth seven categories where a home rule unit could impose a tax. See id. Section 8-11-6a, as originally enacted, provided in pertinent part as follows:\n\"Except as provided in Section 8-11-1, 8-11-5 and 8-11-6, on and after September 1, 1990, no home rule municipality has the authority to impose, pursuant to its home rule authority, a retailer's occupation tax, service occupation tax, use tax, sales tax or other tax on the use, sale or purchase of tangible personal property based on the gross receipts from such sales or the selling or purchase price of said tangible personal property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section does not preempt any home rule imposed tax such as the following : (1) a tax on alcoholic beverages, whether based on gross receipts, volume sold or any other measurement; (2) a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products ; (3) a tax, however measured, based on the use of a hotel or motel room or similar facility; (4) a tax, however measured, on the sale or transfer of real property; (5) a tax, however measured, on lease receipts; (6) a tax on food prepared for immediate consumption and on alcoholic beverages * * *; or (7) other taxes not based on the selling or purchase price or gross receipts from the use, sale or purchase of tangible personal property. * * * This Section is a limitation, pursuant to subsection (g) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, on the power of home rule units to tax.\" (Emphases added.) Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 24, ¶ 8-11-6a.\n¶ 22 Relevant to the issue in this case section 8-11-6a originally provided: \"this Section does not preempt any home rule imposed tax such as the following * * * (2) a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products.\" (Emphasis added.) Id. Thus, beginning on September 1, 1990, a home rule municipality, such as the City, was allowed to impose a tax based on the selling or purchase price or gross receipts from the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products. See id.\n¶ 23 The City maintains that \"or\" was employed in the first iteration of the statute in the inclusive sense and thus the statute allowed a home rule unit the power to tax either cigarettes, or non-cigarette tobacco products, or both. We agree with the City's interpretation. Viewing the statute as a whole, which we must ( Sinkus v. BTE Consulting , 2017 IL App (1st) 152135, ¶ 14, 411 Ill.Dec. 245, 72 N.E.3d 1251 ), it is evident that the legislature intended to create broad descriptions for the categories in section 8-11-6a. For example, when describing places of accommodations, the legislature employed the phrase \"hotel or motel room or similar facility.\" Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 24, ¶ 8-11-6a(3). The legislature also used the word \"or\" to put together different transactions involving real property. Id. ¶ 8-11-6a(4). Likewise, \"cigarettes or tobacco products\" is a wide category that describes goods that contain nicotine. A tenant of statutory construction is that \"a word or phrase that is repeated in a statute is presumed to have the same meaning throughout.\" Borg v. Village of Schiller Park Police Pension Board , 111 Ill. App. 3d 653, 657, 67 Ill.Dec. 395, 444 N.E.2d 631 (1982). Thus, the legislature's original inclusive use of the word \"or\" in section 8-11-6a created broad categories where home rule units could impose taxes on the property stated in the seven exceptions.\n¶ 24 In addition, our case law supports the conclusion that the word \"or\" can be used in an inclusive sense. See Campbell v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America , 15 Ill. 2d 308, 311, 155 N.E.2d 9 (1958). Whether \"or\" is used in the inclusive sense is determined by the context in which it is used. See Coalition for Political Honesty v. State Board of Elections , 65 Ill. 2d 453, 466, 3 Ill.Dec. 728, 359 N.E.2d 138 (1976) ; see also Sinkus , 2017 IL App (1st) 152135, ¶ 14, 411 Ill.Dec. 245, 72 N.E.3d 1251 (\"In interpreting a statute, we must view the statute as a whole, making sure not to read any of its language in isolation.\"). In this case, the circuit court concluded the \"or\" was used in the exclusive or disjunctive sense, relying on the case of People v. Frieberg , 147 Ill. 2d 326, 168 Ill.Dec. 108, 589 N.E.2d 508 (1992). We initially observe that Frieberg involved the interpretation of a criminal statute, but regardless, it did set forth the general proposition that, \"As used in its ordinary sense, the word 'or' marks an alternative indicating the various members of the sentence which it connects are to be taken separately.\" Id. at 349, 168 Ill.Dec. 108, 589 N.E.2d 508 (citing People v. Vraniak , 5 Ill. 2d 384, 125 N.E.2d 513 (1955) ; Campbell , 15 Ill. 2d 308, 155 N.E.2d 9 ). While we do not disagree with this proposition, it is also true that \"or\" can mean \"and\" when considered in context to effectuate the legislature's intent.\n¶ 25 To this end, we find the cases cited by the City to be instructive, as in those cases the reviewing courts examined the context in which the word \"or\" was employed to interpret the legislature's intent. See Apex Oil Co. v. Henkhaus , 118 Ill. App. 3d 273, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032 (1983) ; Thoman v. Village of Northbrook , 148 Ill. App. 3d 356, 101 Ill.Dec. 919, 499 N.E.2d 507 (1986). In Apex Oil Co. , the plaintiff, a sublessee of a tract of land that was leased to the Tri-City Port District of Madison County, Illinois (Port District) from the United States of America, brought an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against certain officials of Madison County regarding the assessment and collection of property taxes. Apex Oil Co. , 118 Ill. App. 3d at 274-75, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032. While the plaintiff subleased the land and had erected six storage tanks thereon, two other storage tanks present on the property were owned by the Port District. Id. at 275, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032. In 1979, the value of the plaintiff's leasehold was assessed to include the value of the leasehold estate as well as the improvements thereon, including the two storage tanks owned by the Port District. Id. at 275-76, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032. The plaintiff disagreed with the assessment calculation and maintained that the taxes were not authorized on both the value of the leasehold and the improvements owned by others. Id. at 276, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032. In considering this claim, the reviewing court construed the language of the section 19.19 of the Revenue Act of 1939 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 120, ¶ 500.19), which read in pertinent part:\n\" 'All property of every kind belonging to the Chicago Regional Port District or any other port district created by the legislature of this State, provided that a tax may be levied upon a lessee of such a District by reason of the value of a leasehold estate separate and apart from the fee, or upon such improvements as are constructed and owned by others than the Port District.' \" (Emphasis in original.) Apex Oil Co. , 118 Ill. App. 3d at 275, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032 (quoting Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 120, ¶ 500.19).\nIn determining whether the plaintiff should have been taxed on the value of its leasehold and the improvements constructed thereon, the reviewing court determined\n\"the disjunction 'or' in section 19.19 is of no significance as it appears to us unlikely that the legislature intended to require local assessing authorities to choose between valuing the leasehold without consideration of the value of improvements erected by others or the improvements erected by others without consideration of the current market rental value of the lease.\" Id. at 278, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032.\nAccordingly, the court concluded that the proper interpretation of section 19.19 was that \"a tax may be levied upon the value of the leasehold which includes improvements erected thereon by the lessor, or upon the leasehold and improvements erected thereon by others, so that regardless of ownership of the improvements, they will not be exempt from taxation.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Id. at 279, 73 Ill.Dec. 783, 454 N.E.2d 1032. In reaching this conclusion, the Apex Oil Co. court recognized that \"the disjunctive 'or' and conjunctive 'and' are not always employed in statutory drafting to express the true legislative purpose, and when it seems apparent that a literal reading would produce a result not intended, the literal meaning may be altered to express the true legislative purpose.\" Id.\n¶ 26 Similarly, in Thoman this court construed certain language in the Road Construction Injuries Act ( Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 121, ¶ 314.1 ) to determine whether the defendants in a negligence case, consisting of a governmental agency and its employee, were exempted from liability. Thoman , 148 Ill. App. 3d at 357, 101 Ill.Dec. 919, 499 N.E.2d 507. There, the plaintiff suffered injuries when her automobile collided with defendant Daniel McGee's vehicle. Id. McGee was an employee of defendant Village of Northbrook and was engaged in road repairs while operating a vehicle owned by the Village of Northbrook at the time of the collision. Id. The plaintiff's lawsuit alleged two counts: (1) negligence and (2) violations of the Road Construction Injuries Act. Id. The defendants then moved to dismiss count II arguing that the language of the Road Construction Injuries Act exempted them from liability. Id. The trial court granted the motion, and the plaintiff appealed. Id.\nÂ¶ 27 On appeal, the reviewing court considered the following language of the Road Construction Injuries Act: \" 'The provisions of this Act shall not apply to employees or officials of the State of Illinois or any other public agency engaged in the construction or the maintenance of highways and bridges.' \" Id. (quoting Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 121, ¶ 314.8 ). The plaintiff maintained that this section did not exempt local governments (such as the Village of Northbrook) and their employees from the duties and liabilities imposed by the statute and urged that \"since the word 'or' is used in the phrase 'of the State of Illinois or any other public agency,' this phrase must be read in the disjunctive.\" Id. at 357-58, 101 Ill.Dec. 919, 499 N.E.2d 507. The plaintiff argued that based on this construction, the exemption was not intended to apply to any governmental body but was only intended to apply to certain employees or officials of those governmental bodies. Id. at 358, 101 Ill.Dec. 919, 499 N.E.2d 507.\n¶ 28 The reviewing court was not persuaded by the plaintiff's argument. In reaching the conclusion that the statute exempted government agencies as well as their employees and officials from the provisions of the Road Construction Injury Act, the court explained:\n\"We are also mindful of the rule that the disjunction 'or' and conjunction 'and' are not always employed in statutory drafting to express the true legislative purpose, and when it seems apparent that a literal reading would produce a result not intended, the literal meaning may be altered to express the true legislative purpose. [Citation.] We believe the use of the disjunction 'or' in section 8 is of no significance as it appears to us unlikely that the legislature intended to carve out an exemption for governmental employees and officials and not the agencies they represent.\" Id. at 359, 101 Ill.Dec. 919, 499 N.E.2d 507.\n¶ 29 Following the guidance of Apex and Thoman , when viewing the original section 8-11-6a in its entirety ( Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 24, ¶ 8-11-6a ), it is apparent that the legislature intended to carve out broad categories that home rule units would be allowed to tax and that the use of the word \"or\" in \"cigarettes or tobacco products\" was originally employed by the legislature in an inclusive sense so as to cover the gamut of nicotine based products.\n¶ 30 In 1993, the general assembly amended section 8-11-6a(2) to impose a limitation on \"a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products.\" Besides this limitation, the language of the statute remained the same:\n\"Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section does not preempt any home rule imposed tax such as the following: * * * (2) a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products (provided, however, that a home rule municipality that has not imposed a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products before July 1, 1993, shall not impose such a tax after that date) [.]\" (Emphasis added.) 65 ILCS 5/8-116a(2) (West 2016).\nWhen adding this parenthetical clause to section 8-11-6a(2), the legislature mirrored the language that appeared in the original statute, \"cigarettes or tobacco products.\" As previously determined, it was the legislature's intent to carve out a broad category. \"Where a meaning is attributed to a word and it again appears in the same statute, it should be given consistent meaning unless a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed.\" Chapman v. County of Will , 55 Ill. 2d 524, 529-30, 304 N.E.2d 287 (1973) ; Borg , 111 Ill. App. 3d at 657, 67 Ill.Dec. 395, 444 N.E.2d 631. Construing these terms consistently within the statute and in light of its original meaning, it follows that either a tax based on the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products or both must have been in effect prior to July 1, 1993, in order for a home rule unit's power to tax \"cigarettes or tobacco products\" not to be preempted.\n¶ 31 In addition, the legislature's repeated use of the words \"a tax\" in section 8-11-6a(2) supports our interpretation. The description of what a home rule unit is allowed to tax (the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products) is introduced with an indefinite article, \"a tax.\" The word \"a\" is an indefinite article and is used in English to \"refer to a person or thing that is not identified or specified.\" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/indefinite% 20article (last visited Dec. 4, 2018) [https://perma.cc/AX98-2F4R]. Thus, according to the basic principles of grammar, when an indefinite article prefaces a noun, that noun refers to something general rather than something specific. Accordingly, based on common grammar principles and our prior conclusion that the legislature intended to allow a home rule unit to tax a broad category of nicotine products, the words \"a tax\" as employed in the context of section 8-11-6a(2) refers not to a specific tax, but to a tax generally on either cigarettes or tobacco products or both. See Warner v. King , 267 Ill. 82, 87, 107 N.E. 837 (1915) (the grammatical construction of a statute is one mode of interpretation and \"[s]tatutes * * * are to be read and understood primarily according to their grammatical sense, unless it is apparent from a perusal of the context of the whole statute that the Legislature did not express its intention\"); see also People v. Cherry Valley Public Library District , 356 Ill. App. 3d 893, 896-97, 293 Ill.Dec. 438, 828 N.E.2d 748 (2005) (interpreting a statute based on the grammar of the statute itself); Lyons Township ex rel. Kielczynski v. Village of Indian Head Park , 2017 IL App (1st) 161574, ¶ 26, 416 Ill.Dec. 641, 84 N.E.3d 1118 (employing the \"commonly understood principles of grammar and usage\" to interpret a statute). Reading section 8-11-6a(2) in its entirety, it follows that the legislature intended for a home rule municipality to be able to tax cigarettes or tobacco products so long as the home rule municipality had \"a tax \" in place on either \"cigarettes or tobacco products\" prior to July 1, 1993. (Emphasis added.) 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6a (West 2016).\n¶ 32 We conclude that because the City had enacted a tax on cigarettes prior to July 1, 1993, it fulfilled the condition of the statute that \"a tax\" exist on either the number of units of cigarettes or tobacco products. Thus, the City is not preempted from now enacting a tax on other tobacco products. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court granting plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and denying the City's motion for summary judgment.\n¶ 33 CONCLUSION\n¶ 34 The judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is reversed.\n¶ 35 Reversed.\nPresiding Justice McBride and Justice Burke concurred in the judgment and opinion.",
